<l n="1"> Because of Fauvel, whom I see stroked so much—</l>
<l n="2"> Sweetly, without flaying him—</l>
<l n="3"> I have become melancholic,</l>
<l n="4"> Because he is such a well-polished beast.</l>
<l n="5"> Often they see him in painting,</l>
<l n="6"> Those who do not know if he stands for</l>
<l n="7"> Mockery, wisdom or folly.</l>
<l n="8"> And because of this, without ambiguous language,</l>
<l n="9"> I will say about this beast</l>
<l n="10"> Whatever comes into my mind.</l>
<l n="11"> Fauvel does not live in a stable any more;</l>
<l n="12"> He has a more honorable house.</l>
<l n="13"> He asks for a higher manger</l>
<l n="14"> A beautiful hayrack and much food.</l>
<l n="15"> He has taken up residence in the hall,</l>
<l n="16"> In order to better demonstrate his royalty;</l>
<l n="17"> And nevertheless, through his knowledge,</l>
<l n="18"> In the other rooms he is also revered,</l>
<l n="19"> And in the cloakrooms often</l>
<l n="20"> He has his entourage assemble—</l>
<l n="21"> Which so caringly brushes him</l>
<l n="22"> So that no droppings can remain on him.</l>
<l n="23"> Fortune, contrary to Reason,</l>
<l n="24"> Has made him master of her house:</l>
<l n="25"> She puts great effort into glorifying him,</l>
<l n="26"> For she leads him into the royal palace;</l>
<l n="27"> She does not stop obtaining honors for him.</l>
<l n="28"> Around Fauvel, there is such a great hoard</l>
<l n="29"> Of people from all countries</l>
<l n="30"> And of all conditions</l>
<l n="31"> That it is a great marvel:</l>
<l n="32"> There is no one who does not prepare himself</l>
<l n="33"> To wipe him down gently.</l>
<l n="34"> There is such a great gathering!</l>
<l n="35"> You could see kings, dukes and counts</l>
<l n="36"> United to wipe down Fauvel.</l>
<l n="37"> All worldly lords and princes</l>
<l n="38"> Come there from all provinces</l>
<l n="39"> Along with great and minor knights</l>
<l n="40"> Who are well suited to rubbing him.</l>
<l n="41"> Know that there is neither king nor count</l>
<l n="42"> Who feels shame in rubbing Fauvel.</l>
<l n="43"> Viscounts, officials and bailiffs</l>
<l n="44"> Have not failed to rub him;</l>
<l n="45"> Bourgeois from the villages and cities</l>
<l n="46"> Rub with great ingenuity,</l>
<l n="47"> And peasants from rural areas</l>
<l n="48"> Stand next to Fauvel to feed him.</l>
<l n="49"> And to a public consistory</l>
<l n="50"> Fauvel goes, a true animal,</l>
<l n="51"> And when the pope sees such an animal,</l>
<l n="52"> Know that he holds a great feast for him,</l>
<l n="53"> And the cardinals honor him greatly</l>
<l n="54"> And all rush to rub him.</l>
<l n="55"> The vice chancellors, the notaries,</l>
<l n="56"> Auditors and record keepers</l>
<l n="57"> Take great pains</l>
<l n="58"> To rub Fauvel appropriately.</l>
<l n="59"> Prelates do not spare [trips through] mountain or valley</l>
<l n="60"> To rub this noble horse.</l>
<l n="61"> Abbots and religious people</l>
<l n="62"> Show him the utmost devotion. </l>
<l n="63"> Dominicans and Franciscans, where are you?</l>
<l n="64"> This time, do not be stupid.</l>
<l n="65"> Rather, make sure you study well</l>
<l n="66"> How to caress Fauvel:</l>
<l n="67"> This is, in fact, what you do—God help me—</l>
<l n="68"> And everyone is astonished by it.</l>
<l n="69"> The Augustinians, nuns and monks,</l>
<l n="70"> The archdeacons and canons,</l>
<l n="71"> And the clerks whose needs are met by the Church</l>
<l n="72"> Have rushed to rub him,</l>
<l n="73"> And the poor clerks who have no income</l>
<l n="74"> Give him their complete attention</l>
<l n="75"> But cannot get as close to him</l>
<l n="76"> Or as far forward as the important people,</l>
<l n="77"> And for this reason they are despondent and full of anger.</l>
<l n="78"> One often hears them say</l>
<l n="79"> That Fortune, who is not stable,</l>
<l n="80"> And who never stops turning,</l>
<l n="81"> Will make those in the front fall back,</l>
<l n="82"> And the high, low and those far away, close.</l>
<l n="83"> The fact that Fortune turns so quickly</l>
<l n="84"> And does not ever put a stop to her turning</l>
<l n="85"> Brings comfort to the poor</l>
<l n="86"> And distracts them in their unhappiness.</l>
<l n="87"> And even when they cannot come</l>
<l n="88"> To pet or touch Fauvel,</l>
<l n="89"> They say: “May God keep this beast;</l>
<l n="90"> He has a beautiful body and a beautiful head.”</l>
<l n="91"> Now it is appropriate to make known the manner,</l>
<l n="92"> The behaviors and the expressions</l>
<l n="93"> That are adopted to rub Fauvel.</l>
<l n="94"> You cannot recognize a book from its cover; </l>
<l n="95"> For this reason it is good to know them,</l>
<l n="96"> Since many pet him who do not leave a trace.</l>
<l n="97"> I will begin with the pope.</l>
<l n="98"> It is not reasonable for him to escape</l>
<l n="99"> But I declare</l>
<l n="100"> That it is not my intention</l>
<l n="101"> To go against the honor of Rome,</l>
<l n="102"> To which all men owe obedience,</l>
<l n="103"> But about Fauvel I will tell the truth,</l>
<l n="104"> As I can conceive it. </l>
<l n="105"> The pope sits in his seat</l>
<l n="106"> Which used to be made of rock, and now is made of fragile oak.</l>
<l n="107"> He looks at Fauvel, when he is in his presence,</l>
<l n="108"> He to whom one pays great respect,</l>
<l n="109"> And whom one rubs, in the evening and in the morning.</l>
<l n="110"> The pope also extends his hand</l>
<l n="111"> And holds him gently from the harness</l>
<l n="112"> Without reproaching anyone for rubbing him,</l>
<l n="113"> And then he scratches Fauvel’s head</l>
<l n="114"> While saying: “This is a beautiful animal!”</l>
<l n="115"> In order to please him, the cardinals say:</l>
<l n="116"> “You speak the truth, Holy Father!”</l>
<l n="117"> And then they put their hands on Fauvel</l>
<l n="118"> And begin to pet him;</l>
<l n="119"> It seems to me they hold combs</l>
<l n="120"> And brush him around the head.</l>
<l n="121"> I don’t know how they put ointment on him</l>
<l n="122"> But they trim the hair on his head.</l>
<l n="123"> In that place, kings from all countries</l>
<l n="124"> Are not astonished to rub him.</l>
<l n="125"> There is one who surpasses all the others</l>
<l n="126"> And who is the lord of all of them.</l>
<l n="127"> He has forgotten his rank.</l>
<l n="128"> In order to pet Fauvel, he steps forward.</l>
<l n="129"> With one hand he cuts his mane</l>
<l n="130"> And with the other he holds a comb.</l>
<l n="131"> But he does not have a mirror</l>
<l n="132"> —he should rent one—.</l>
<l n="133"> He should have one,</l>
<l n="134"> For he needs to know. </l>
<l n="135"> After the kings, the counts rub</l>
<l n="136"> So sweetly that they do not break the skin</l>
<l n="137"> Prelates and abbots, for their part,</l>
<l n="138"> Take their part in rubbing Fauvel,</l>
<l n="139"> On the back and around his flanks,</l>
<l n="140"> Nobody leaves Fauvel's side,</l>
<l n="141"> Under his stomach and in front of his sex,</l>
<l n="142"> One rubs well and the other poorly.</l>
<l n="143"> Priests, deans, archdeacons</l>
<l n="144"> Do not behave as if they were gout-ridden.</l>
<l n="145"> From all sides they come at a gallop</l>
<l n="146"> And they rub Fauvel and his feet.</l>
<l n="147"> Knights do not miss the call;</l>
<l n="148"> They rub Fauvel on his croup.</l>
<l n="149"> The squires, who are arrogant,</l>
<l n="150"> Lift his feet and clean them,</l>
<l n="151"> And they prepare him a new bed,</l>
<l n="152"> So that Fauvel makes a great feast for them.</l>
<l n="153"> Canons, chaplains and parish priests,</l>
<l n="154"> Monks and nuns with all kinds of habits,</l>
<l n="155"> Through woods, cities and marshlands</l>
<l n="156"> Rub Fauvel's hocks;</l>
<l n="157"> Between his thighs, near his groin,</l>
<l n="158"> They rub his nerves and veins,</l>
<l n="159"> And Cordeliers and Jacobins,</l>
<l n="160"> When it comes to petting, are true robins;</l>
<l n="161"> They rub in front and then behind.</l>
<l n="162"> They know how to do it too well!</l>
<l n="163"> And poor people come to rub,</l>
<l n="164"> But they stay near the tail</l>
<l n="165"> And do the best they can to come closer.</l>
<l n="166"> They cut his tail and braid it.</l>
<l n="167"> Now, they have all come to rub,</l>
<l n="168"> The rich, and the large and small monks.</l>
<l n="169"> If we want to understand this book,</l>
<l n="170"> We must now turn</l>
<l n="171"> To describing Fauvel properly</l>
<l n="172"> And to saying, through definition,</l>
<l n="173"> What Fauvel means to us;</l>
<l n="174"> But beforehand, it is fitting that I speak</l>
<l n="175"> Of his color first.</l>
<l n="176"> Aristotle says truly:</l>
<l n="177"> Accidents are a great help</l>
<l n="178"> In making known the substance.</l>
<l n="179"> Fauvel does not have a black color,</l>
<l n="180"> For the black color reminds us</l>
<l n="181"> Of death, of pain, and of sadness,</l>
<l n="182"> And Fauvel is full of joy,</l>
<l n="183"> So he is not interested in dressing in black.</l>
<l n="184"> It does not conform to his nature.</l>
<l n="185"> Nor is he of a red color.</l>
<l n="186"> He does not compare himself to this color,</l>
<l n="187"> For the red color signifies</l>
<l n="188"> Charity, friend of everyone.</l>
<l n="189"> Fauvel is not interested in such a dress,</l>
<l n="190"> For he only loves those who rub him.</l>
<l n="191"> Nor does he have a white color,</l>
<l n="192"> Because this signifies</l>
<l n="193"> That which is clean and pure;</l>
<l n="194"> But Fauvel is so full of excrement</l>
<l n="195"> That it is necessary to brush him every day.</l>
<l n="196"> For this reason, he does not have a white robe.</l>
<l n="197"> If he had one, it would be a waste!</l>
<l n="198"> Nor does he have a green robe,</l>
<l n="199"> For green signifies</l>
<l n="200"> Loyal faith and hope;</l>
<l n="201"> But Fauvel has put all of his faith</l>
<l n="202"> In his present fortune</l>
<l n="203"> Without hoping for the kind that lasts,</l>
<l n="204"> Nor does he care about faithfulness.</l>
<l n="205"> He does not have a blue coat</l>
<l n="206"> For such a color eternally</l>
<l n="207"> Denotes consideration</l>
<l n="208"> Of good, of wisdom and of reason.</l>
<l n="209"> This can be demonstrated through the sapphire,</l>
<l n="210"> Where one must find a blue color.</l>
<l n="211"> And the ethereal firmament</l>
<l n="212"> Also truly resembles blue.</l>
<l n="213"> But Fauvel does not solidly possess</l>
<l n="214"> The fortune he has found,</l>
<l n="215"> And he does not consider the end,</l>
<l n="216"> Rather he searches for everything that pleases him.</l>
<l n="217"> And Fauvel—may God save me—</l>
<l n="218"> Can only have a beige color,</l>
<l n="219"> And even on his back—one must know this—</l>
<l n="220"> He cannot have a black stripe.</l>
<l n="221"> This kind of color denotes vanity:</l>
<l n="222"> For a vain animal, a vain coat.</l>
<l n="223"> He is also so low down in the front</l>
<l n="224"> That it pains many people;</l>
<l n="225"> And he limps with all four legs,</l>
<l n="226"> But he crosses them so ingeniously</l>
<l n="227"> That it is difficult to tell,</l>
<l n="228"> For he is an animal full of malice.</l>
<l n="229"> Now it is time that I reveal the mystery</l>
<l n="230"> Of Fauvel more openly,</l>
<l n="231"> In order to make known his allegorical explanation</l>
<l n="232"> And also his description.</l>
<l n="233"> Fauvel is an appropriate animal</l>
<l n="234"> Ordered through similitude</l>
<l n="235"> To signify vain things,</l>
<l n="236"> Trickery and the falseness of the world.</l>
<l n="237"> Thus, through etymology,</l>
<l n="238"> One can know what he means:</l>
<l n="239"> FAUVEL is made of FAUS [false] and VEL [veil]</l>
<l n="240"> For he has built his pride</l>
<l n="241"> On veiled falsity</l>
<l n="242"> And honey-sweetened trickery.</l>
<l n="243"> Flattery is derived from his name,</l>
<l n="244"> Which has neither source nor bank in goodness.</l>
<l n="245"> From Fauvel comes Flattery,</l>
<l n="246"> Which has sovereignty in the world,</l>
<l n="247"> And then comes Avarice,</l>
<l n="248"> Who is not selfish when it comes to rubbing Fauvel,</l>
<l n="249"> Vileness and Variété [inconstancy],</l>
<l n="250"> And then Envy and Lâcheté [cowardliness].</l>
<l n="251"> These six ladies whom I have named</l>
<l n="252"> Are signified by FAUVEL.</l>
<l n="253"> If you want to apply your intelligence,</l>
<l n="254"> Take a word from each letter.</l>
<l n="255"> Of Fauvel, who reigns on the Earth,</l>
<l n="256"> Through differences and through war.</l>
<l n="257"> I will give the definition,</l>
<l n="258"> To better show my intention. </l>
<l n="259"> Fauvel is not a reasonable animal</l>
<l n="260"> He is all appearances and not stable;</l>
<l n="261"> Full of deception, empty of truth,</l>
<l n="262"> A figure made for deceiving people.</l>
<l n="263"> Fauvel is truly an animal</l>
<l n="264"> For otherwise he could not have</l>
<l n="265"> Sovereignty over other animals.</l>
<l n="266"> One can know this through reason:</l>
<l n="267"> The king of men is a man,</l>
<l n="268"> The eagle is the king of the birds just as</l>
<l n="269"> The lion is the king of animals.</l>
<l n="270"> Know, therefore, you who are present,</l>
<l n="271"> That Fauvel, this noble lord,</l>
<l n="272"> Is the sovereign and greatest</l>
<l n="273"> Of all men who, like animals,</l>
<l n="274"> Put their hearts and heads in the world.</l>
<l n="275"> Such men we should call animals,</l>
<l n="276"> Of whom Fauvel is the king and lord.</l>
<l n="277"> He is the equal of a Templar heretic,</l>
<l n="278"> He who makes Fauvel his idol.</l>
<l n="279"> Fauvel is an animal, and he is an animal also</l>
<l n="280"> Whoever honors and celebrates him.</l>
<l n="281"> Now I want to tell you and prove</l>
<l n="282"> Why Fauvel is devoid of reason:</l>
<l n="283"> He should stay supine in his stable</l>
<l n="284"> But for no amount of money would he do this</l>
<l n="285"> For he does not want to stay in his place.</l>
<l n="286"> He does nothing but come and go.</l>
<l n="287"> In order to obtain a good manger.</l>
<l n="288"> He applies himself in order to please.</l>
<l n="289"> In trickery and falseness,</l>
<l n="290"> He has placed all of his intelligence.</l>
<l n="291"> He has come and gone so much</l>
<l n="292"> That he will never be held</l>
<l n="293"> Or stopped by a bit or a bridle.</l>
<l n="294"> He races everywhere and runs and gallops.</l>
<l n="295"> He follows Fortune without reason</l>
<l n="296"> And thus he reigns in every season.</l>
<l n="297"> In order to lift himself up, he applies himself hard</l>
<l n="298"> In the instruction manual of flattery,</l>
<l n="299"> So that he can make the fake shine brightly,</l>
<l n="300"> Render truth silent and take away what is right.</l>
<l n="301"> His definition, discussed above,</l>
<l n="302"> I have given; may it be enough for you.</l>
<l n="303"> Now I will discuss his manner,</l>
<l n="304"> In continuing with my material,</l>
<l n="305"> How and why Fauvel, in an abundant way,</l>
<l n="306"> Fauvel transforms the world into his pasture</l>
<l n="307"> And how both the great and the small</l>
<l n="308"> Are eager to rub him.</l>
<l n="309"> God, the omnipotent king,</l>
<l n="310"> Who knows all,</l>
<l n="311"> In the beginning when he made</l>
<l n="312"> The world, with glory,</l>
<l n="313"> He put each creature in its proper place</l>
<l n="314"> And gave it its own nature. </l>
<l n="315"> He ordered everything so wisely,</l>
<l n="316"> That no man can, unless he lies,</l>
<l n="317"> Pretend that he has any fault—</l>
<l n="318"> For no one possesses such a degree of mastery.</l>
<l n="319"> But what he had ordained</l>
<l n="320"> Is so changed and poorly led</l>
<l n="321"> That it is necessary, according to reason,</l>
<l n="322"> That we be near the moment</l>
<l n="323"> When the world will come to an end,</l>
<l n="324"> And God will make another world.</l>
<l n="325"> Reason makes a strong argument:</l>
<l n="326"> First of all, since, without any instrument,</l>
<l n="327"> It pleased God to make the world</l>
<l n="328"> And he wanted to depict out of clay</l>
<l n="329"> Mankind and mold him in his image.</l>
<l n="330"> To man he gave such an advantage,</l>
<l n="331"> That he made him the king of animals</l>
<l n="332"> And the greatest in nobility;</l>
<l n="333"> But now everything is all topsy-turvy,</l>
<l n="334"> That which God had prepared,</l>
<l n="335"> For men have turned into animals.</l>
<l n="336"> They hold their heads close to the ground:</l>
<l n="337"> Nothing interests them except owning land,</l>
<l n="338"> They do not wish to know anything about God.</l>
<l n="339"> Nor do they ever look towards the sky</l>
<l n="340"> For they burn in the fire of covetousness.</l>
<l n="341"> The operation demonstrates the argument that</l>
<l n="342"> Form is shaped in the same way</l>
<l n="343"> As the work.</l>
<l n="344"> For this reason, I say certainly</l>
<l n="345"> That men have truly become animals</l>
<l n="346"> When they live in the manner of animals.</l>
<l n="347"> And for this reason we can rightly say</l>
<l n="348"> That Fauvel is the lord of the world</l>
<l n="349"> For he is honored everywhere</l>
<l n="350"> And adored as a God on Earth.</l>
<l n="351"> Reason has lost her sovereignty</l>
<l n="352"> When we see bestiality</l>
<l n="353"> Placed so high above men.</l>
<l n="354"> And falsity breaking reason. </l>
<l n="355"> Thus is divine order</l>
<l n="356"> Completely ruined.</l>
<l n="357"> We go through night without a lantern,</l>
<l n="358"> When bestiality governs us.</l>
<l n="359"> Alas! Why is Fauvel not mourned [as dead]</l>
<l n="360"> Since he has so completely upturned the world!</l>
<l n="361"> Everyone finds in him a great desire</l>
<l n="362"> To obtain human favor.</l>
<l n="363"> Alas, alas! When I see</l>
<l n="364"> That for Fauvel—may fire consume him—</l>
<l n="365"> The Holy Church today</l>
<l n="366"> Is so debased and in such trouble</l>
<l n="367"> That it will only be able to right itself with difficulty!</l>
<l n="368"> Every day I see it so oppressed</l>
<l n="369"> That it is a great marvel</l>
<l n="370"> That Saint Peter does not prepare</l>
<l n="371"> Assistance for his boat,</l>
<l n="372"> Which rocks so horribly</l>
<l n="373"> That all of Christianity</l>
<l n="374"> Should be terrified;</l>
<l n="375"> Those who rule are dazzled!</l>
<l n="376"> Know that Noah’s Ark</l>
<l n="377"> Was never in such great peril</l>
<l n="378"> Under the movement of any wave</l>
<l n="379"> Of being submerged and destroyed</l>
<l n="380"> As the boat mentioned above.</l>
<l n="381"> That is to say, the present Church,</l>
<l n="382"> Which is represented by the boat,</l>
<l n="383"> From all sides is assailed,</l>
<l n="384"> Never in it is there joy or feasting;</l>
<l n="385"> In desolation, it can well sing</l>
<l n="386"> The lamentation</l>
<l n="387"> Of Jeremiah, the prophet;</l>
<l n="388"> I think it was composed for her!</l>
<l n="389"> The lady of kings and of princes,</l>
<l n="390"> Princess of all provinces,</l>
<l n="391"> Lies today submitted to the tribute,</l>
<l n="392"> More than has ever been seen</l>
<l n="393"> Since the early Church</l>
<l n="394"> Was built and brought to the bank.</l>
<l n="395"> Fauvel, who is false and broken</l>
<l n="396"> Constructed this evil trick:</l>
<l n="397"> Fortune turns just as he wants</l>
<l n="398"> And upends that which God has made.</l>
<l n="399"> Now I want to show you the way</l>
<l n="400"> In which he turns everything upside down.</l>
<l n="401"> Now listen, you who rub Fauvel!</l>
<l n="402"> In the beginning, God made two big torches,</l>
<l n="403"> Full of brilliant light,</l>
<l n="404"> But he made them in a different manner.</l>
<l n="405"> One is called the sun, the other the moon.</l>
<l n="406"> One gives us light in the day;</l>
<l n="407"> It is the sun, which shines in the day,</l>
<l n="408"> And the moon in the night without rest.</l>
<l n="409"> But the sun—may God help me—</l>
<l n="410"> Is situated much higher in the firmament</l>
<l n="411"> Than the moon, without doubt,</l>
<l n="412"> Nor does it have any light</l>
<l n="413"> That the sun does not send it.</l>
<l n="414"> But Fauvel, who sets everything off its course,</l>
<l n="415"> Has acted so that this source of light</l>
<l n="416"> Is completely reversed.</l>
<l n="417"> He is an animal with much power!</l>
<l n="418"> He placed the moon above the sun,</l>
<l n="419"> So that the sun does not have light</l>
<l n="420"> Except from the moon, from which it is backlit.</l>
<l n="421"> You can find a great eclipse there!</l>
<l n="422"> What I have told you I want to prove.</l>
<l n="423"> Sages, using reason,</l>
<l n="424"> Make similar comparisons</l>
<l n="425"> Between the sun and the priests</l>
<l n="426"> And the sun, which is beneath,</l>
<l n="427"> They compare to earthly power.</l>
<l n="428"> I want to tell you the reason for this.</l>
<l n="429"> God, who is lord and master of everything,</l>
<l n="430"> Made his son be born from the Virgin,</l>
<l n="431"> Who practiced sacrifice like a priest;</l>
<l n="432"> For this reason, the priesthood</l>
<l n="433"> Should be compared to the sun,</l>
<l n="434"> For God gave it the authority</l>
<l n="435"> To give light to the world,</l>
<l n="436"> Through which it would be able to lift its heart and head,</l>
<l n="437"> In order to make known the true path</l>
<l n="438"> Towards eternal joy.</l>
<l n="439"> God led the priesthood in this way</l>
<l n="440"> For he commanded they lead the Church [?] </l>
<l n="441"> And wanted to create the power in it</l>
<l n="442"> To link and unlink everything.</l>
<l n="443"> But over worldly power</l>
<l n="444"> God gave nobody sovereignty,</l>
<l n="445"> Rather he wanted it to be under the priesthood,</l>
<l n="446"> To serve as the arm of the Holy Church,</l>
<l n="447"> Such that it only had the power to do</l>
<l n="448"> That which would please the Church.</l>
<l n="449"> And you can see this through reasoning:</l>
<l n="450"> The arm must obey the head</l>
<l n="451"> And put into action</l>
<l n="452"> That which the head commands.</l>
<l n="453"> Through its nature, the arm is always ready</l>
<l n="454"> To keep the head from injury</l>
<l n="455"> For the head is situated higher in man.</l>
<l n="456"> Than any other member, as it is</l>
<l n="457"> The one that governs the whole body.</l>
<l n="458"> Through it, one desires, hears and understands.</l>
<l n="459"> And if the head were sick,</l>
<l n="460"> There is no other member, however vigorous,</l>
<l n="461"> That would not be in a great position of weakness,</l>
<l n="462"> As are servants towards their lord.</l>
<l n="463"> Thus must temporal power</l>
<l n="464"> Obey in humility</l>
<l n="465"> The Holy Church, which is the lady</l>
<l n="466"> Who can link body and soul.</l>
<l n="467"> But Fauvel has fauveled so much</l>
<l n="468"> And rolled his cart so well</l>
<l n="469"> That, despite Ferrand and Morel,</l>
<l n="470"> Secular power</l>
<l n="471"> Which should be low like the moon,</l>
<l n="472"> Has, through Fortune’s wheel,</l>
<l n="473"> Sovereignty over the Holy Church.</l>
<l n="474"> The Church is so far down that it has trouble</l>
<l n="475"> Giving even the slightest bit of light.</l>
<l n="476"> Thus is everything topsy-turvy.</l>
<l n="477"> The rest of the body is above the head.</l>
<l n="478"> There would be a great need that</l>
<l n="479"> God create a new world,</l>
<l n="480"> For this one is overflowing with all evil,</l>
<l n="481"> For Fauvel governs it</l>
<l n="482"> In darkness and with no lantern,</l>
<l n="483"> In such a way that he has thrown it off course.</l>
<l n="484"> One cannot find it mentioned in any manuscript</l>
<l n="485"> Or in any book of Holy Scripture</l>
<l n="486"> For it has never before been so out of measure</l>
<l n="487"> As we see it now.</l>
<l n="488"> Fauvel is lying there permanently,</l>
<l n="489"> For he is the master the dice game.</l>
<l n="490"> Out of everyone, he leads the dance.</l>
<l n="491"> He makes it turn and turn again</l>
<l n="492"> In order to jumble and upend everything;</l>
<l n="493"> He has put his intelligence and attention towards this so much</l>
<l n="494"> That today every creature</l>
<l n="495"> Is turned around and contrary</l>
<l n="496"> To that for which God made him.</l>
<l n="497"> I will show you this in all levels of society</l>
<l n="498"> Through arguments which do not lack proofs.</l>
<l n="499"> First, with respect to ecclesiastics,</l>
<l n="500"> Who should have good qualities,</l>
<l n="501"> Without gloss and without commentary</l>
<l n="502"> I will tell you clearly:</l>
<l n="503"> Such people—it is obvious—</l>
<l n="504"> Have begun to act in topsy-turvy fashion.</l>
<l n="505"> In the time of early religion,</l>
<l n="506"> From which human salvation derives,</l>
<l n="507"> When God wed the Holy Church</l>
<l n="508"> And saved it with his blood,</l>
<l n="509"> He made Saint Peter his vicar</l>
<l n="510"> And wanted him to be pastor and father</l>
<l n="511"> And to govern Christianity.</l>
<l n="512"> He gave him an abundance of power</l>
<l n="513"> And did the same for the apostles</l>
<l n="514"> Such that, through their teaching, </l>
<l n="515"> Humanity might come onto the path</l>
<l n="516"> Through which to reach eternal joy.</l>
<l n="517"> These apostles had disciples</l>
<l n="518"> Who received, under their guidance, the power</l>
<l n="519"> To link everything and unlink it</l>
<l n="520"> And to reconcile us with God.</l>
<l n="521"> The apostles became bishops</l>
<l n="522"> For they principally received responsibility</l>
<l n="523"> For governing the Church.</l>
<l n="524"> And when faith was in its beginnings,</l>
<l n="525"> Disciples spread themselves</l>
<l n="526"> Around the world and worked</l>
<l n="527"> To multiply the faith,</l>
<l n="528"> And they thought to apply themselves</l>
<l n="529"> So that they won over many souls</l>
<l n="530"> Who became ladies in Paradise.</l>
<l n="531"> Saint Peter, who was a pope,</l>
<l n="532"> Did not dress himself in precious cloth,</l>
<l n="533"> Nor did he live from exactions.</l>
<l n="534"> His only consolation</l>
<l n="535"> Was to live as a saint</l>
<l n="536"> And to act so that the world would be delivered</l>
<l n="537"> From the slavery of sin</l>
<l n="538"> And that it would be set on the course of good.</l>
<l n="539"> And when he had worked</l>
<l n="540"> And prayed to God for his people,</l>
<l n="541"> He did not care for a life of begging.</l>
<l n="542"> Rather, in order to obtain food,</l>
<l n="543"> He lived from fishing</l>
<l n="544"> And thereby gained a modest life.</l>
<l n="545"> But, know this: he did not know how to fish.</l>
<l n="546"> He owned a small net</l>
<l n="547"> And a small boat,</l>
<l n="548"> And only caught a few minnows</l>
<l n="549"> And other small fish.</l>
<l n="550"> And in this way his life was sustained.</l>
<l n="551"> But our current pope</l>
<l n="552"> Fishes in a much better spot.</l>
<l n="553"> He has a large and strong fishing line</l>
<l n="554"> Which brings him florins of gold</l>
<l n="555"> So that Saint Peter and his boat</l>
<l n="556"> Tremble and are tossed about.</l>
<l n="557"> He fishes for innumerable florins.</l>
<l n="558"> He does not think about how the shadow</l>
<l n="559"> Of Saint Peter used to cure</l>
<l n="560"> Anyone who complained of any pain.</l>
<l n="561"> Saint Peter lived without wealth,</l>
<l n="562"> But now his successor has such a profusion of it</l>
<l n="563"> That it is a great marvel.</l>
<l n="564"> For Fauvel applies himself and makes sure</l>
<l n="565"> To bring him many florins,</l>
<l n="566"> And he can never grow tired of them.</l>
<l n="567"> The pope—I will not hide it from you—</l>
<l n="568"> Rubs Fauvel in front of the king</l>
<l n="569"> For the jewels he presents him,</l>
<l n="570"> And he exerts his energy in pleasing him. </l>
<l n="571"> He sends him revenues from his taxes</l>
<l n="572"> And offers him prebends</l>
<l n="573"> For his clerks, everywhere and generously.</l>
<l n="574"> Alas! How evil is this behavior</l>
<l n="575"> For in this situation we see the Church</l>
<l n="576"> Pay the tribute and find itself in a precarious position</l>
<l n="577"> Since Fauvel, who is literate in this area,</l>
<l n="578"> Has obtained the taxes</l>
<l n="579"> For the king, with the approval of the pope.</l>
<l n="580"> The pope does not wear his cape,</l>
<l n="581"> Nor is he the tutor of the clergy</l>
<l n="582"> But is made into the executor of the king,</l>
<l n="583"> Such that through lay justice</l>
<l n="584"> Governs the Holy Church.</l>
<l n="585"> This is something done deliberately.</l>
<l n="586"> There is no use in protesting.</l>
<l n="587"> Thus the pope rubs Fauvel</l>
<l n="588"> So much that he flays the clergy,</l>
<l n="589"> Although he does not appear to touch them,</l>
<l n="590"> But the Holy Church trembles in all its parts.</l>
<l n="591"> What can we say of the cardinals</l>
<l n="592"> Without driving them to anger?</l>
<l n="593"> With all reverence due to them,</l>
<l n="594"> We can pronounce this judgment:</l>
<l n="595"> That they resemble the first apostles</l>
<l n="596"> Very little, it seems to me.</l>
<l n="597"> The first apostles were</l>
<l n="598"> Poor, and they lived poorly.</l>
<l n="599"> They were full of charity</l>
<l n="600"> And based their existence on humility.</l>
<l n="601"> Now the dice have changed, alas!</l>
<l n="602"> For our prelates act in a different way.</l>
<l n="603"> I cannot tell a good story about them</l>
<l n="604"> For Avarice and Vainglory</l>
<l n="605"> Have removed them from the right path.</l>
<l n="606"> They are too close to them.</l>
<l n="607"> They are pastors, but only to feed themselves.</l>
<l n="608"> Today the wolf is the master of the sheep!</l>
<l n="609"> They know well how to take off the wool</l>
<l n="610"> So close to the skin that it bleeds;</l>
<l n="611"> They are always ready to sheer</l>
<l n="612"> And they do not wait for summer.  </l>
<l n="613"> In all seasons they pluck and pillage.</l>
<l n="614"> It is Fauvel who wants this, for they pet him</l>
<l n="615"> And rub him gently.</l>
<l n="616"> They sing Placebo loudly</l>
<l n="617"> But dirige they sing without notes.</l>
<l n="618"> There is an earthquake all over</l>
<l n="619"> For the earth turns backwards</l>
<l n="620"> And clerks and laypeople, monks and city dwellers</l>
<l n="621"> Are turned upside down.</l>
<l n="622"> Alas! How is it that young prelates</l>
<l n="623"> Who have no knowledge of the Church</l>
<l n="624"> Are installed through simony.</l>
<l n="625"> They hold the name of holy father</l>
<l n="626"> And they are children. It must not please</l>
<l n="627"> God that the Church, his spouse,</l>
<l n="628"> Is held in the hands of such prelates.</l>
<l n="629"> They are not confident leaders;</l>
<l n="630"> Young people are not so mature!</l>
<l n="631"> Nevertheless, with a little distance,</l>
<l n="632"> I would not be able to distinguish</l>
<l n="633"> Which prelates</l>
<l n="634"> Do their duty today the best:</l>
<l n="635"> Some, of whom I will speak later on,</l>
<l n="636"> Participant in the counsel of the king.</l>
<l n="637"> In the investigations, in judgments,</l>
<l n="638"> In the courts of justice, in the parliaments,</l>
<l n="639"> Our prelates go; they understand all of this well.</l>
<l n="640"> The goods of the Church depend on them.</l>
<l n="641"> The poor have a meager part</l>
<l n="642"> For Fauvel splits up the alms</l>
<l n="643"> And spends everything on parties.</l>
<l n="644"> And to the poor people, he gives nothing.</l>
<l n="645"> Through such prelates, as I see it,</l>
<l n="646"> The Church today is more devoid of</l>
<l n="647"> Faith than has ever been seen before.</l>
<l n="648"> Through them, the king is often</l>
<l n="649"> Led to impose high taxes</l>
<l n="650"> On the Church and to cause it pain.</l>
<l n="651"> Through the prelates, who are eager to please</l>
<l n="652"> The king and to do his bidding</l>
<l n="653"> The Holy Church is fallen today</l>
<l n="654"> And loses its liberty today as well.</l>
<l n="655"> Such prelates are not fathers</l>
<l n="656"> But rather stepfathers who do not love</l>
<l n="657"> The children of their spouses</l>
<l n="658"> Through whom honors are given to them:</l>
<l n="659"> The children, whose mother they do not love,</l>
<l n="660"> Cannot please them.</l>
<l n="661"> Our prelates fulfill their duties</l>
<l n="662"> For they are posts of elder</l>
<l n="663"> And of reed in the Holy Church.</l>
<l n="664"> They support it in such a way</l>
<l n="665"> That they pinch and cut their subjects</l>
<l n="666"> And fail them in all of their needs. </l>
<l n="667"> Every day they go from bad to worse.</l>
<l n="668"> It is no longer a time to look</l>
<l n="669"> Among their actions for an example to follow,</l>
<l n="670"> But they must know and understand</l>
<l n="671"> That God, at the Last Judgment,</l>
<l n="672"> Will take a cruel vengeance.</l>
<l n="673"> Alas! And why do they not think,</l>
<l n="674"> Our prelates, who hold themselves in such high esteem today?</l>
<l n="675"> Because of the goods they possess and their income</l>
<l n="676"> From the Church, they have directed their attention</l>
<l n="677"> To pride and to vanity:</l>
<l n="678"> They constantly want—this is the truth—</l>
<l n="679"> To have honors and be served</l>
<l n="680"> With genuflection and with bows</l>
<l n="681"> Of all varieties, with hats taken off.</l>
<l n="682"> They receive such honors from all sides</l>
<l n="683"> That, in the end, they do not seem to be</l>
<l n="684"> Born from woman or man.</l>
<l n="685"> Rather, they increase their station every day:</l>
<l n="686"> They do not think of the debt</l>
<l n="687"> They will have in the final accounting.</l>
<l n="688"> May God preserve them so that they are not ashamed!</l>
<l n="689"> The vainglory from which they drink so abundantly</l>
<l n="690"> And their honors deceive them.</l>
<l n="691"> They are inebriated, and they do not remember</l>
<l n="692"> What they must do.</l>
<l n="693"> Reason tells me and suggests to me</l>
<l n="694"> That they did not enter through the door</l>
<l n="695"> Through which prelates used to enter</l>
<l n="696"> But that they climbed over the walls</l>
<l n="697"> In a way different from Cephas.</l>
<l n="698"> They have done so much through licit and illicit means</l>
<l n="699"> That these climbers [?] have control</l>
<l n="700"> Of the Church—this is the worst.</l>
<l n="701"> Fauvel carries them to the walls</l>
<l n="702"> And Simony, who is strong,</l>
<l n="703"> Gets the ladder ready for them.</l>
<l n="704"> They climb it so fast that it is a marvel.</l>
<l n="705"> It seems to be that, in my time, I have not seen</l>
<l n="706"> A prelate elected</l>
<l n="707"> Because he led a holy life,</l>
<l n="708"> But rather illustrious lineage or simony</l>
<l n="709"> Impose their will completely.</l>
<l n="710"> Without them, no clerk is ever appointed</l>
<l n="711"> If he does not seek a position through servility.</l>
<l n="712"> In this also, Fauvel deceives,</l>
<l n="713"> For the well-tested servant</l>
<l n="714"> Is often paid much less</l>
<l n="715"> And receives less in prebends than someone</l>
<l n="716"> Who comes after him and is worth less.</l>
<l n="717"> The good person does not worry about flattery,</l>
<l n="718"> And the other knows well how to scratch Fauvel.</l>
<l n="719"> And Fauvel, who distributes prebends,</l>
<l n="720"> Does not consider the character</l>
<l n="721"> Of the person who serves him well,</l>
<l n="722"> But rather the person who rubs him.</l>
<l n="723"> For this reason, they often waste their time,</l>
<l n="724"> They who exert themselves in serving these types of people.</l>
<l n="725"> May God grant consideration to our prelates</l>
<l n="726"> So that they are better advised</l>
<l n="727"> To love faith, reason, and rectitude,</l>
<l n="728"> As well as those who are under their care.</l>
<l n="729"> They are the head of the Holy Church.</l>
<l n="730"> For this reason, I tell them again:</l>
<l n="731"> That through their notable flaws</l>
<l n="732"> The Church, which was once high,</l>
<l n="733"> Is now low, suffering and humbled,</l>
<l n="734"> Like the boat beneath the net,</l>
<l n="735"> So that one can no longer reap benefit there</l>
<l n="736"> Because the fishermen are to blame.</l>
<l n="737"> Let us turn now to the other levels</l>
<l n="738"> Of the Church: we see too few</l>
<l n="739"> Who have not left their appropriate station,</l>
<l n="740"> Among the canons, monks, clerks and priests.</l>
<l n="741"> The canons despise the Church</l>
<l n="742"> And go there infrequently, except when they hope</l>
<l n="743"> That they will be able to obtain money there;</l>
<l n="744"> In this way, they fulfill their duty poorly.</l>
<l n="745"> Their principal task must be</l>
<l n="746"> To pay to God what is owed him,</l>
<l n="747"> To praise him and to adore him,</l>
<l n="748"> And to honor, in the Church,</l>
<l n="749"> The great and the humble equally.</l>
<l n="750"> They must not think, in the first place, </l>
<l n="751"> Of monetary compensation.</l>
<l n="752"> This would not please God.</l>
<l n="753"> If they behave in this manner,</l>
<l n="754"> They throw everything upside down.</l>
<l n="755"> They receive generous prebends,</l>
<l n="756"> But they only meagerly serve</l>
<l n="757"> He from whom all goods come.</l>
<l n="758"> Alas! how they expose them to great peril,</l>
<l n="759"> The prebends of the Holy Church,</l>
<l n="760"> If they do not serve</l>
<l n="761"> In the way the Church has ordained!</l>
<l n="762"> Some say—but they are not wise—</l>
<l n="763"> That prebends are free,</l>
<l n="764"> But they make black shoes white.</l>
<l n="765"> They receive goods from the Church,</l>
<l n="766"> But they spend them, eat them, drink them,</l>
<l n="767"> And ruin them in a terrible way</l>
<l n="768"> Without rendering any service to God</l>
<l n="769"> In the places where they should stay</l>
<l n="770"> And honor God.</l>
<l n="771"> All ecclesiastical benefices</l>
<l n="772"> Are given for the holy office:</l>
<l n="773"> Therefore, may he be careful, he who holds a great number</l>
<l n="774"> For he is obligated to perform a service for each one.</l>
<l n="775"> They are well equipped, the canons</l>
<l n="776"> Whom Saint Benoît-le-Bestourné</l>
<l n="777"> Counts today in his circle,</l>
<l n="778"> And who lead a backwards life.</l>
<l n="779"> They do not live in the manner of clerks,</l>
<l n="780"> But rather of animals.</l>
<l n="781"> Some ride on richly-adorned horses,</l>
<l n="782"> And others are always outside.</l>
<l n="783"> They are the sons or nephews of Fauvel.</l>
<l n="784"> Their horses have curly hair.</l>
<l n="785"> They are the stepsons of the Church</l>
<l n="786"> For they play the nobleman too much.</l>
<l n="787"> They have fancy hairdos and shoes with laces.</l>
<l n="788"> They should cry out “alas!”</l>
<l n="789"> If they looked at the crucifix,</l>
<l n="790"> And if they contemplated themselves in it,</l>
<l n="791"> How he is raised on the cross,</l>
<l n="792"> How his shoes are tight,</l>
<l n="793"> And how he is dressed!</l>
<l n="794"> They should not be so stubborn,</l>
<l n="795"> Or as crazy, these canons,</l>
<l n="796"> As to ruin the goods of their master.</l>
<l n="797"> Of the parish priests, what will we say?</l>
<l n="798"> We will read a bit about their position:</l>
<l n="799"> They are well known everywhere,</l>
<l n="800"> For they are seen close up.</l>
<l n="801"> I'll speak of them briefly now.</l>
<l n="802"> Nevertheless, I will not be so silent</l>
<l n="803"> As to say nothing</l>
<l n="804"> Of their position and life.</l>
<l n="805"> When the churches used to be empty,</l>
<l n="806"> The good prelates used to give them </l>
<l n="807"> To clerks who had good morals</l>
<l n="808"> And who understood Scripture</l>
<l n="809"> And who knew how to preach</l>
<l n="810"> So as to rid their subjects</l>
<l n="811"> Of sin, when they were present,</l>
<l n="812"> And who knew how to put them on the right path.</l>
<l n="813"> But the parish churches</l>
<l n="814"> Are entrusted today</l>
<l n="815"> To those who have too little instruction.</l>
<l n="816"> For this reason, I am not surprised</l>
<l n="817"> If the people live in a foolish manner</l>
<l n="818"> Since they are governed in a foolish manner.</l>
<l n="819"> The great pastors and the small</l>
<l n="820"> Do not desire</l>
<l n="821"> To apply themselves to their duties today.</l>
<l n="822"> They are foolish and full of vice</l>
<l n="823"> So much that they do not know how to apply themselves.</l>
<l n="824"> The blind man leads the blind man</l>
<l n="825"> Such that, as is fitting, both fall.</l>
<l n="826"> Lord God, when I remember</l>
<l n="827"> Priests who are parish priests</l>
<l n="828"> Who know no measure</l>
<l n="829"> And how they lead a filthy life,</l>
<l n="830"> And do not maintain their position or order,</l>
<l n="831"> My heart is thoroughly frightened.</l>
<l n="832"> They put the laypeople off of the right path;</l>
<l n="833"> They cannot find an example</l>
<l n="834"> In the Church or outside of it,</l>
<l n="835"> The lay people, with all their worries,</l>
<l n="836"> Who are all covered with the filth of sin.</l>
<l n="837"> Alas! It is a great misfortune</l>
<l n="838"> When the task of safekeeping</l>
<l n="839"> People and advising them is given to the insane;</l>
<l n="840"> Everyone must marvel at this!</l>
<l n="841"> Fauvel does not want it any other way.</l>
<l n="842"> He is delighted when everything proceeds in an insane fashion!</l>
<l n="843"> Of people in monastic orders,</l>
<l n="844"> I would also like to make mention.</l>
<l n="845"> To see how order is maintained.</l>
<l n="846"> With the Mendicants, I would like to start,</l>
<l n="847"> But it is not to reprimand them</l>
<l n="848"> Or to flatter them—this is not my desire.</l>
<l n="849"> Saint Francis and Saint Dominic</l>
<l n="850"> Started two orders, which</l>
<l n="851"> Were founded on poverty;</l>
<l n="852"> Without lands or possessions</l>
<l n="853"> The [members of these] two orders must</l>
<l n="854"> Live humbly—this is obvious.</l>
<l n="855"> But Fauvel, who is the king of trickery,</l>
<l n="856"> Did them a special favor</l>
<l n="857"> Because they sing from the Placebo.</l>
<l n="858"> They take great care to please in the world, </l>
<l n="859"> And to attract girls, </l>
<l n="860"> Who visit and frequent them.</l>
<l n="861"> They want to have responsibility for souls</l>
<l n="862"> Everywhere, of men and women,</l>
<l n="863"> They want to stick their noses in everything:</l>
<l n="864"> They are not real monastics,</l>
<l n="865"> Such people who are so eager</l>
<l n="866"> To devote their attention to the world.</l>
<l n="867"> There is too great a distinction</l>
<l n="868"> Between the world and religion:</l>
<l n="869"> One to the other is the opposite.</l>
<l n="870"> Whoever enters the orders</l>
<l n="871"> And then returns to the world he has left behind</l>
<l n="872"> Is like the dog that returns to its vomit.</l>
<l n="873"> The mendicant orders</l>
<l n="874"> Cause many problems today</l>
<l n="875"> Because they change their nature.</l>
<l n="876"> They are poor people with many riches;</l>
<l n="877"> They leave everything behind, and they want to have everything!</l>
<l n="878"> Outside of the world, they have wordly desires.</l>
<l n="879"> One no longer knows—may God help me!—</l>
<l n="880"> Marriage or testament,</l>
<l n="881"> Agreement or compromise,</l>
<l n="882"> Without the intervention of courtiers,</l>
<l n="883"> The secular hypocrites,</l>
<l n="884"> The mendicant orders.</l>
<l n="885"> It is a disorderly order</l>
<l n="886"> That puts the hand on the plow</l>
<l n="887"> And then looks backwards.</l>
<l n="888"> In this way, it deceives us,</l>
<l n="889"> The habit of the order</l>
<l n="890"> That outside is hypocritical</l>
<l n="891"> And inside nothing but deception,</l>
<l n="892"> And which always seeks time and space</l>
<l n="893"> In order to satisfy its desires.</l>
<l n="894"> They have covered Fauvel in so much incense</l>
<l n="895"> That he has given them the right</l>
<l n="896"> To have their own property.</l>
<l n="897"> As to those who are not mendicants,</l>
<l n="898"> And who have ecclesiastical income and lands</l>
<l n="899"> To perform the divine office,</l>
<l n="900"> Today, the black and white monks,</l>
<l n="901"> The gray ones and the regular canons,</l>
<l n="902"> They are full of desire and greed!</l>
<l n="903"> Their conscience does not reproach them,</l>
<l n="904"> To see how they are dead to the world</l>
<l n="905"> Without private affections,</l>
<l n="906"> But it is completely the opposite!</l>
<l n="907"> They are dead to God and alive to the world</l>
<l n="908"> And bring death to devotion.</l>
<l n="909"> It is they who live in the world.</l>
<l n="910"> They are there every day, and dwell there. </l>
<l n="911"> They detest nothing so much as the cloister.</l>
<l n="912"> There are few who enter the orders</l>
<l n="913"> Who do not have the full intention</l>
<l n="914"> Of obtaining offices and improving their positions.</l>
<l n="915"> When they stay in the cloister a little,</l>
<l n="916"> And return to the world afterwards,</l>
<l n="917"> They have completely deviated from sense;</l>
<l n="918"> They are not afraid of blame or shame,</l>
<l n="919"> And do not take account of the fact</l>
<l n="920"> That they are devoted to Christ.</l>
<l n="921"> They have religious garb</l>
<l n="922"> But there is little good that lives</l>
<l n="923"> Under those frocks and surcoats today.</l>
<l n="924"> God is mocked through these sorts of people.</l>
<l n="925"> Lord Fauvel, who often delivers sermons,</l>
<l n="926"> Is their abbot.</l>
<l n="927"> He has played the tawny animal so well</l>
<l n="928"> That the orders—may God save me—</l>
<l n="929"> Are completely disordered.</l>
<l n="930"> It is clear that Fauvel is a bad leader;</l>
<l n="931"> He has already derailed an order</l>
<l n="932"> That was one of the most honored.</l>
<l n="933"> He has played the cruel beast so well</l>
<l n="934"> That the Holy Church, our mother,</l>
<l n="935"> Cries out loudly and laments.</l>
<l n="936"> The open trickery of the Templars,</l>
<l n="937"> Which brought them to death, and to their loss,</l>
<l n="938"> Made her a sad and mournful mother.</l>
<l n="939"> This makes her sigh and groan,</l>
<l n="940"> Such that every man who is a true son </l>
<l n="941"> Of the Holy Church must tremble.</l>
<l n="942"> The Templars have brought her to sadness,</l>
<l n="943"> And she laments, in great distress,</l>
<l n="944"> And complains in this way:</l>
<l n="945"> “Alas! What misfortune,</l>
<l n="946"> What a terrible thing and a horrible fate,</l>
<l n="947"> That my children have deserted me!</l>
<l n="948"> The Templars, whom I loved so much,</l>
<l n="949"> And who had brought me so much honor,</l>
<l n="950"> Have brought me shame and done base things.</l>
<l n="951"> I nourished them and fed them my milk</l>
<l n="952"> And molded them as much as I could</l>
<l n="953"> To defend the Holy Land</l>
<l n="954"> Against the infidel Saracens,</l>
<l n="955"> But now I see they are so deviant</l>
<l n="956"> That they have begun a war against Jesus Christ!</l>
<l n="957"> They have rejected my dear spouse,</l>
<l n="958"> Who was crucified for them</l>
<l n="959"> And whose sign they used to wear.</l>
<l n="960"> Alas! Why did they want to do this?</l>
<l n="961"> I was always a sweet, gracious and kind</l>
<l n="962"> Mother towards them.</l>
<l n="963"> They wore the sign of the cross;</l>
<l n="964"> They were supposed to be</l>
<l n="965"> The upholders and champions of Christianity;</l>
<l n="966"> For this reason they were very honored</l>
<l n="967"> And exalted everywhere, and they had</l>
<l n="968"> Income and great possessions.</l>
<l n="969"> I never did them any harm;</l>
<l n="970"> On the contrary, they held the goods</l>
<l n="971"> Of the true Crucifix in abundance,</l>
<l n="972"> As well as the rights and privileges.</l>
<l n="973"> Alas, they have now become heretics,</l>
<l n="974"> And sinners against nature.</l>
<l n="975"> My heart is crushed and torn</l>
<l n="976"> Because they remained in the traps of the enemy</l>
<l n="977"> For so long.</l>
<l n="978"> They were all piled there.</l>
<l n="979"> More than a hundred years have passed</l>
<l n="980"> Since their misdeeds were committed.</l>
<l n="981"> Amongst themselves, they had created an order</l>
<l n="982"> So horrible, so vile, so filthy</l>
<l n="983"> That it is a terrible thing to tell:</l>
<l n="984"> As soon as they received someone</l>
<l n="985"> They made him renounce God entirely</l>
<l n="986"> And express disdain for Jesus Christ and the Cross.</l>
<l n="987"> They ordered that it be spit upon,</l>
<l n="988"> And they kissed each other’s asses.</l>
<l n="989"> They were in a very vile state!</l>
<l n="990"> Alas! What a shame that they were born from Adam,</l>
<l n="991"> For they will be cursed,</l>
<l n="992"> And dispersed, and crushed.</l>
<l n="993"> Alas, alas! This is only reasonable,</l>
<l n="994"> Since they spent much too long</l>
<l n="995"> Leading an unregulated life.</l>
<l n="996"> If they had reigned longer,</l>
<l n="997"> Christianity, certainly,</l>
<l n="998"> Would be completely poisoned.</l>
<l n="999"> God, who wants to take vengeance,</l>
<l n="1000"> Did a great favor for the king of France,</l>
<l n="1001"> In making him realize what was happening.</l>
<l n="1002"> God called him, in his love,</l>
<l n="1003"> When he revealed this evil to him,</l>
<l n="1004"> Which up until this point had not been revealed.</l>
<l n="1005"> Saint Louis and the King of Sicily</l>
<l n="1006"> Had heard reports in their time</l>
<l n="1007"> Of the suspect Templiers;</l>
<l n="1008"> They attempted to learn more </l>
<l n="1009"> But they never were able to have</l>
<l n="1010"> The whole truth during their time.</l>
<l n="1011"> But this nephew of Saint Louis</l>
<l n="1012"> Must be pleased and joyful,</l>
<l n="1013"> Since he reached the truth:</l>
<l n="1014"> He has put much labor and work</l>
<l n="1015"> Into establishing the truth with certainty.</l>
<l n="1016"> He did his duty very well.</l>
<l n="1017"> Diligently, like a good man,</l>
<l n="1018"> In front of the apostle of Rome,</l>
<l n="1019"> He pursued this task</l>
<l n="1020"> Such that the Templars recognized,</l>
<l n="1021"> Among the greatest who were in their order,</l>
<l n="1022"> Their shameful acts in front of the pope.</l>
<l n="1023"> There would be as much pain as great shame</l>
<l n="1024"> To speak of this at more length;</l>
<l n="1025"> It is better that I remain silent.</l>
<l n="1026"> They have been damned and put to death;</l>
<l n="1027"> He is insane, he who does not exert himself</l>
<l n="1028"> To do whatever pleases Fauvel!</l>
<l n="1029"> Fauvel has repaid them to well</l>
<l n="1030"> For the care they took</l>
<l n="1031"> In living in the world falsely.</l>
<l n="1032"> This is the payment for those who serve many masters.</l>
<l n="1033"> When Fauvel lets his own feed,</l>
<l n="1034"> He gives them their payment.</l>
<l n="1035"> Alas! The worldly lords</l>
<l n="1036"> Do not give a damn about anything</l>
<l n="1037"> Except that Fauvel be well rubbed.</l>
<l n="1038"> I do not know anyone today, by my honor,</l>
<l n="1039"> No great lord or lady</l>
<l n="1040"> Who is not completely infatuated with him.</l>
<l n="1041"> One does not worry about moral probity:</l>
<l n="1042"> Falsity is everywhere, in sum,</l>
<l n="1043"> And is made welcome and honored;</l>
<l n="1044"> False Seeming and Disloyalty</l>
<l n="1045"> Reign over the world</l>
<l n="1046"> And Truth is kicked to the ground.</l>
<l n="1047"> He can easily visit the great lords,</l>
<l n="1048"> He who knows how to sing Placebo.</l>
<l n="1049"> This song pleases them very much.</l>
<l n="1050"> They do not care for an entourage</l>
<l n="1051"> That does not grant them immediately</l>
<l n="1052"> All of their desires.</l>
<l n="1053"> Even when it is not reasonable,</l>
<l n="1054"> They still want everyone, in all instances,</l>
<l n="1055"> To tell them “Well said, my lord!”</l>
<l n="1056"> They are happy when they are considered wise.</l>
<l n="1057"> Oh, God! There are so many false faces</l>
<l n="1058"> In the kingdom and the empire!</l>
<l n="1059"> The servants are false, the lords are false,</l>
<l n="1060"> The small people are false, the great are false,</l>
<l n="1061"> Everyone today is false.</l>
<l n="1062"> The lords attempt to wear down</l>
<l n="1063"> Their subjects and to levy</l>
<l n="1064"> Taxes on them.</l>
<l n="1065"> The great lords—it is a marvel—</l>
<l n="1066"> Do not want to receive any advice</l>
<l n="1067"> Other than what is already in their heads</l>
<l n="1068"> Such that many do not dare to tell the truth</l>
<l n="1069"> Lest they anger their lords.</l>
<l n="1070"> Thus they robe the tawny beast.</l>
<l n="1071"> There is no longer a king, duke or count</l>
<l n="1072"> Who has not been perverted shamefully.</l>
<l n="1073"> They should be troubled,</l>
<l n="1074"> For they do not act according to rights or justice.</l>
<l n="1075"> Their whole attention is devoted</l>
<l n="1076"> To acquiring without paying anything in return.</l>
<l n="1077"> Kings and counts used to</l>
<l n="1078"> Found and support churches</l>
<l n="1079"> Generously, with the goods they had,</l>
<l n="1080"> But now they ruin them:</l>
<l n="1081"> They plunder and steal the Crucifix,</l>
<l n="1082"> And steal its goods in all manners.</l>
<l n="1083"> They hate the Church and the clergy;</l>
<l n="1084"> They refuse to accomplish any good acts,</l>
<l n="1085"> Both knights and squires.</l>
<l n="1086"> They value their nobility today so much</l>
<l n="1087"> That they despise other people,</l>
<l n="1088"> So much that it must trouble many.</l>
<l n="1089"> The nobles are full of base behavior. </l>
<l n="1090"> These are opposites,</l>
<l n="1091"> Base behavior and nobility,</l>
<l n="1092"> And for this reason, it seems to me</l>
<l n="1093"> That they cannot be combined.</l>
<l n="1094"> Wisdom is worth more than foolish nobility!</l>
<l n="1095"> Nobility, as the sage says,</l>
<l n="1096"> Comes only from qualities of the heart</l>
<l n="1097"> Which is adorned with good manners.</l>
<l n="1098"> Know that it does not come from the stomach.</l>
<l n="1099"> The stomach is excrement and it becomes excrement.</l>
<l n="1100"> Nobody is noble from such a place.</l>
<l n="1101"> If noblemen thought about</l>
<l n="1102"> How and in what state they were</l>
<l n="1103"> In the stomachs of their mothers...</l>
<l n="1104"> Did they have an advantage there</l>
<l n="1105"> More than the lower classes?</l>
<l n="1106"> How can one get them out of there?</l>
<l n="1107"> Did they have noble food?</l>
<l n="1108"> I ask them another question:</l>
<l n="1109"> Did they emerge on horseback,</l>
<l n="1110"> These noblemen who are so agile?</l>
<l n="1111"> Their bowels are not made of silver;</l>
<l n="1112"> Are they not equally descended from man?</l>
<l n="1113"> We are all born from a single seed,</l>
<l n="1114"> Such that there is no difference</l>
<l n="1115"> Between peasant and nobleman:</l>
<l n="1116"> We are all born from Eve and Adam</l>
<l n="1117"> And we are all condemned to death</l>
<l n="1118"> Because he bit into the apple.</l>
<l n="1119"> The pride of this world is miserable,</l>
<l n="1120"> Because it is the profound valley,</l>
<l n="1121"> Full of calamity and pain.</l>
<l n="1122"> Festivities and feast have no place</l>
<l n="1123"> Except for those who rub the beast</l>
<l n="1124"> Who is entirely of a tawny color.</l>
<l n="1125"> This is Fauvel, who turns everything upside down,</l>
<l n="1126"> He makes the nobleman a peasant and makes</l>
<l n="1127"> The peasant lead a noble life.</l>
<l n="1128"> The nobleman of high lineage</l>
<l n="1129"> He makes proud and full of arrogance,</l>
<l n="1130"> Such that they lose their nobility.</l>
<l n="1131"> The whole world, it seems to me,</l>
<l n="1132"> Resembles a plow pulled by dogs.</l>
<l n="1133"> One pulls forward, and the other backwards.</l>
<l n="1134"> The lords want to be too great</l>
<l n="1135"> And the subjects imitate the masters.</l>
<l n="1136"> This is the occupation of the stretcher-bearer.</l>
<l n="1137"> Because the kings are liars</l>
<l n="1138"> And rich men flatterers,</l>
<l n="1139"> And prelates full of vanity,</l>
<l n="1140"> And noblemen hate the Church,</l>
<l n="1141"> The clergy is a model of vice,</l>
<l n="1142"> Religious orders are full of pleasure,</l>
<l n="1143"> Rich men without charity,</l>
<l n="1144"> Merchants without truth,</l>
<l n="1145"> Workers without loyalty,</l>
<l n="1146"> Hosts full of cruelty,</l>
<l n="1147"> Bailiffs and judges without pity,</l>
<l n="1148"> And relatives without true friendship,</l>
<l n="1149"> Neighbors loose-tongued and full of envy,</l>
<l n="1150"> Young children full of malice,</l>
<l n="1151"> —A disloyal and false bunch—</l>
<l n="1152"> And lords full of deceit,</l>
<l n="1153"> Tricksters in good fortune,</l>
<l n="1154"> And petty criminals the leaders of the community,</l>
<l n="1155"> Bodies loved more than souls,</l>
<l n="1156"> And women the lovers of their husbands,</l>
<l n="1157"> The Holy Church little honored,</l>
<l n="1158"> And France fallen into servitude,</l>
<l n="1159"> Through Fauvel, that evil beast,</l>
<l n="1160"> Through whom comes every storm,</l>
<l n="1161"> Since he perverts the world in this way,</l>
<l n="1162"> Everywhere, without measure or limit,</l>
<l n="1163"> And since every creature</l>
<l n="1164"> Has left behind its proper nature,</l>
<l n="1165"> And taken on the opposite, as I have</l>
<l n="1166"> Summarized above,</l>
<l n="1167"> —For I would spend too long</l>
<l n="1168"> If I described everything in detail.</l>
<l n="1169"> I conclude, according to reason,</l>
<l n="1170"> That we are near the moment</l>
<l n="1171"> At which the world must end,</l>
<l n="1172"> For all forms of evil are abundant.</l>
<l n="1173"> The prophecy tells us</l>
<l n="1174"> That when faith will be absent from the world,</l>
<l n="1175"> Then will come</l>
<l n="1176"> The son of God, in the Last Judgment;</l>
<l n="1177"> And I see faith die</l>
<l n="1178"> —It may never come again.</l>
<l n="1179"> If there is a little faith, it is expiring,</l>
<l n="1180"> For faith without deeds is not strong.</l>
<l n="1181"> For this reason, I think the Antichrist has come,</l>
<l n="1182"> Because Cupid reigns, as well as Venus,</l>
<l n="1183"> Everywhere, among the great and the small,</l>
<l n="1184"> And I do not know any woman or man,</l>
<l n="1185"> Who could not truly say</l>
<l n="1186"> That the more one lives in this world, the worse it becomes.</l>
<l n="1187"> This Fauvel does, the lunatic,</l>
<l n="1188"> Who so often follows</l>
<l n="1189"> The advice of Maugis and Basin: </l>
<l n="1190"> He leads everything according to antiphrasis,</l>
<l n="1191"> Which is to say, through contraries.</l>
<l n="1192"> Everyone should maintain a safe distance,</l>
<l n="1193"> For in him and in his face,</l>
<l n="1194"> We see depicted and represented</l>
<l n="1195"> Everything that is false and all flattery,</l>
<l n="1196"> And generalized idolatry.</l>
<l n="1197"> Everyone today follows the school</l>
<l n="1198"> Of catering to Fauvel, the idol.</l>
<l n="1199"> One shows such reverence</l>
<l n="1200"> To everyone who has obtained excellence,</l>
<l n="1201"> In position, wealth or power,</l>
<l n="1202"> That I dare to say, for this reason,</l>
<l n="1203"> That the honor that is due to God</l>
<l n="1204"> Is not paid to him today.</l>
<l n="1205"> One exerts greater efforts today</l>
<l n="1206"> In serving human creatures</l>
<l n="1207"> And in having worldly wealth,</l>
<l n="1208"> Than in serving he whose generosity</l>
<l n="1209"> Includes everything that is eternal.</l>
<l n="1210"> By God, this is completely unreasonable!</l>
<l n="1211"> O, spiritual unicorn, </l>
<l n="1212"> You who are clearer than crystal,</l>
<l n="1213"> Descend and spread your grace!</l>
<l n="1214"> Do not suffer that Fauvel have</l>
<l n="1215"> His bears dance in this world!</l>
<l n="1216"> There are too many of his arrows. </l>
<l n="1217"> Banish Fauvel from France;</l>
<l n="1218"> He has damaged it too much through his whinnying. </l>
<l n="1219"> Here, I want to stop,</l>
<l n="1220"> But I pray to all devoutly:</l>
<l n="1221"> If I have trimmed Fauvel too closely</l>
<l n="1222"> And cut him too close to the [?], </l>
<l n="1223"> If I have spoken stupidly</l>
<l n="1224"> Or superfluously,</l>
<l n="1225"> In any manner at all,</l>
<l n="1226"> By God, may I be pardoned this!</l>
<l n="1227"> God, who is the truth, the path and the life</l>
<l n="1228"> Knows that it is not through envy</l>
<l n="1229"> Or through ill intention that I treat this subject,</l>
<l n="1230"> But so that the deceitful</l>
<l n="1231"> Fauvel can be truly described</l>
<l n="1232"> So plainly and so clearly</l>
<l n="1233"> That the false flatterers will be despised</l>
<l n="1234"> And, from now on, in all countries,</l>
<l n="1235"> Truth be restored,</l>
<l n="1236"> God and the Holy Church loved.</l>
<l n="1237"> He whom I implore, before I fall silent,</l>
<l n="1238"> May this little book, which was made completely</l>
<l n="1239"> In the year 1310, </l>
<l n="1240"> Please him.</l>
<l n="1241"> Under the reign of the kind lion,</l>
<l n="1242"> Whose manner was more benevolent</l>
<l n="1243"> Than was necessary,</l>
<l n="1244"> —This was because of the great honesty</l>
<l n="1245"> That always reigned in him—</l>
<l n="1246"> Certainly, I believe that he now holds</l>
<l n="1247"> The kingdom of paradise.</l>
<l n="1248"> This was Philip, the son</l>
<l n="1249"> Of the brave and good king Philip</l>
<l n="1250"> Who left behind the barrels in Aragon;</l>
<l n="1251"> This one was the son of Saint Louis.</l>
<l n="1252"> I have completed finished my dit,</l>
<l n="1253"> Performing a motet about it.</l>
<l n="1254"> O! Lord God, how he floated</l>
<l n="1255"> On the sea with a good heart and walked on land</l>
<l n="1256"> To conquer the Holy Sepulcher.</l>
<l n="1257"> If the others had followed his example,</l>
<l n="1258"> They would not have begun to love Fauvel,</l>
<l n="1259"> For Loyalty and Truth</l>
<l n="1260"> Would have come back, once Fauvel was overthrown. </l>
<l n="1261"> For Philip, who reigns now,</l>
<l n="1262"> You will also include this motet. [SERVANT REGEM] </l>
<l n="1263"> Of Fauvel, you have heard well</l>
<l n="1264"> How he is rubbed and cleaned.</l>
<l n="1265"> But because it would be necessary</l>
<l n="1266"> For all of humanity</l>
<l n="1267"> To know the story of Fauvel,</l>
<l n="1268"> And to retain it in its memory,</l>
<l n="1269"> For he is the figure of all evil,</l>
<l n="1270"> And, as Scripture tells us,</l>
<l n="1271"> No one can avoid vice</l>
<l n="1272"> If he does not have knowledge of evil,</l>
<l n="1273"> For this reason, I want to add</l>
<l n="1274"> Something that contributes</l>
<l n="1275"> To making more plainly open</l>
<l n="1276"> Fauvel’s situation and business.</l>
<l n="1277"> So that we might live without him</l>
<l n="1278"> I have made about him this second book</l>
<l n="1279"> Which speaks of how Fauvel</l>
<l n="1280"> Married and multiplied.</l>
<l n="1281"> One day Fauvel, who does not seem very jovial,</l>
<l n="1282"> Was in his palace,</l>
<l n="1283"> Even though he has in his possession, in Wales,</l>
<l n="1284"> Castles, dungeons, manners and halls.</l>
<l n="1285"> Around him there was a great abundance</l>
<l n="1286"> Of people related to him</l>
<l n="1287"> (For he did not have, in his entourage,</l>
<l n="1288"> Anyone who was not of his own lineage).</l>
<l n="1289"> He was seated on a folding chair,</l>
<l n="1290"> But I believe that there are not six people here</l>
<l n="1291"> Who ever saw</l>
<l n="1292"> Or had ever heard spoken of one this beautiful:</l>
<l n="1293"> It was so beautiful, by Saint Cosmas,</l>
<l n="1294"> That it seems to be the work of a ghost!</l>
<l n="1295"> It was made with a gold produced through alchemy</l>
<l n="1296"> Which seemed pure, but was not at all;</l>
<l n="1297"> But it shined so brightly</l>
<l n="1298"> That there is no one who is close to it</l>
<l n="1299"> Who is not astonished in seeing it</l>
<l n="1300"> And who does not have a desire to sit there.</l>
<l n="1301"> It was enameled in the Irish way,</l>
<l n="1302"> And decorated in the Saracen way. </l>
<l n="1303"> There were escutcheons of combs</l>
<l n="1304"> Surrounded by feathers,</l>
<l n="1305"> And strewn with several small beasts,</l>
<l n="1306"> Little foxes of both sexes,</l>
<l n="1307"> Snakes, tortoises,</l>
<l n="1308"> Kites, falcons and cranes,</l>
<l n="1309"> Goshawks, vultures and panthers,</l>
<l n="1310"> Hunting birds and chimeras,</l>
<l n="1311"> And animals of different types</l>
<l n="1312"> In bright and expensive colors,</l>
<l n="1313"> And fake escutcheons with lozenges,</l>
<l n="1314"> Around the borders.</l>
<l n="1315"> Deceit, Falseness and Guile</l>
<l n="1316"> Carried the chair in the air</l>
<l n="1317"> —As if through Virgil’s spell—</l>
<l n="1318"> And everyone was completely amazed.</l>
<l n="1319"> There, Fauvel sits nobly,</l>
<l n="1320"> Dressed in a rich fabric of gold,</l>
<l n="1321"> Adorned with small furs.</l>
<l n="1322"> Never will you hear about any more elegant.</l>
<l n="1323"> He had a coat made of Turkish fabric</l>
<l n="1324"> Which Hypocrisy had given him</l>
<l n="1325"> With a gold-banded ribbon.</l>
<l n="1326"> But nothing there was the work of Abel,</l>
<l n="1327"> Rather, Cain’s hands made it,</l>
<l n="1328"> For Fauvel follows his lead.</l>
<l n="1329"> On his head, he had a crown</l>
<l n="1330"> Beautiful and good in appearance:</l>
<l n="1331"> It had precious stones</l>
<l n="1332"> Very pretty to behold;</l>
<l n="1333"> But it did not have any other virtue</l>
<l n="1334"> Than to give pleasure</l>
<l n="1335"> To those who looked at and contemplated them,</l>
<l n="1336"> So as to burn the insane in vanity.</l>
<l n="1337"> As soon as Fauvel had acquired them,</l>
<l n="1338"> The powers God had put in them,</l>
<l n="1339"> Disappeared through Fauvel’s sin</l>
<l n="1340"> But they did not lose their beauty,</l>
<l n="1341"> For which reason they are expensive.</l>
<l n="1342"> They are very expensive, for people</l>
<l n="1343"> Who are rich and full of vanity</l>
<l n="1344"> Draw their glory and arrogance from them.</l>
<l n="1345"> With this kind of crown was decorated</l>
<l n="1346"> Fauvel, who is not saddened.</l>
<l n="1347"> There is none so beautiful as far as the Gironde,</l>
<l n="1348"> But it is not round</l>
<l n="1349"> For Fauvel and all of his people</l>
<l n="1350"> Have a shell-shaped [?] head.</l>
<l n="1351"> But know that his aforementioned palace,</l>
<l n="1352"> Was not covered in red rubies.</l>
<l n="1353"> The palace was covered in slate</l>
<l n="1354"> So pleasant that no one who approaches</l>
<l n="1355"> Is able to leave again,</l>
<l n="1356"> However much pain and torment he finds there.</l>
<l n="1357"> The roof of the palace is shiny,</l>
<l n="1358"> Such that, without measure,</l>
<l n="1359"> It moves everyone to come inside.</l>
<l n="1360"> Anyone has difficulty abstaining</l>
<l n="1361"> If he enters this house,</l>
<l n="1362"> However much he is reasonable,</l>
<l n="1363"> For it is extremely vain and deceitful.</l>
<l n="1364"> After Fauvel has seated him at the table,</l>
<l n="1365"> He will not leave until his death.</l>
<l n="1366"> Fauvel hooks him with sweet bites,</l>
<l n="1367"> So that he no longer</l>
<l n="1368"> Knows how to eat bread in his house.</l>
<l n="1369"> It was richly painted on the inside,</l>
<l n="1370"> The aforementioned palace, and gracefully with</l>
<l n="1371"> Monkeys, small foxes,</l>
<l n="1372"> Made in imitation of a noose—</l>
<l n="1373"> Of tricksters and deceivers,</l>
<l n="1374"> Of lawyers and advocates,</l>
<l n="1375"> Of false judges, and false counselors,</l>
<l n="1376"> False witnesses, false reporters,</l>
<l n="1377"> False hosts, false accountants,</l>
<l n="1378"> False lords and false flatterers;</l>
<l n="1379"> All manners of trickery</l>
<l n="1380"> Were painted there in a great troop.</l>
<l n="1381"> And all around were painted</l>
<l n="1382"> Songs, lais and many ballades,</l>
<l n="1383"> Hockets, motets and little songs,</l>
<l n="1384"> Which were not about love,</l>
<l n="1385"> But about well-tested fraud,</l>
<l n="1386"> Which Master Barat had composed.</l>
<l n="1387"> There, they were marked on the palace,</l>
<l n="1388"> Well written and well notated</l>
<l n="1389"> With flats and fake music.</l>
<l n="1390"> There were also the chronicles</l>
<l n="1391"> Of falsity, here and there,</l>
<l n="1392"> Dating back to the beginning of the world,</l>
<l n="1393"> And of Renart, the whole story</l>
<l n="1394"> Was painted and well recalled.</l>
<l n="1395"> And know that, in this same place,</l>
<l n="1396"> There were several deceitful sophisms,</l>
<l n="1397"> And mixtures of first principles</l>
<l n="1398"> With terms and false premises,</l>
<l n="1399"> In order to engender conclusions</l>
<l n="1400"> Of evil and deception.</l>
<l n="1401"> Even the finer points of the proofs,</l>
<l n="1402"> And the fallacies, which are quick</l>
<l n="1403"> To deceive everyone,</l>
<l n="1404"> Were represented there; this I tell you truly.</l>
<l n="1405"> It was not broken or run down,</l>
<l n="1406"> The palace; rather it had paneling</l>
<l n="1407"> Made beautifully out of wood from Iceland</l>
<l n="1408"> Cut in thick and wide pieces</l>
<l n="1409"> From a wood that was neither bent nor full of holes</l>
<l n="1410"> But was self-contained and watertight.</l>
<l n="1411"> There were aspens that resembled alders,</l>
<l n="1412"> But everything was covered in yellow polish,</l>
<l n="1413"> Sparkling so brightly</l>
<l n="1414"> That no man could truly</l>
<l n="1415"> See the celestial sky from inside</l>
<l n="1416"> Unless he put his head out a window,</l>
<l n="1417"> For the colors were so bright</l>
<l n="1418"> That they blinded those who looked.</l>
<l n="1419"> And if you want me to tell you</l>
<l n="1420"> About those who kept the company</l>
<l n="1421"> Of Fauvel, I will list them,</l>
<l n="1422"> And I will not lie, as much as I can.</l>
<l n="1423"> Next to Fauvel, to his right,</l>
<l n="1424"> Was seated Carnality, his friend,</l>
<l n="1425"> A lady of great authority</l>
<l n="1426"> Who is contrary to Charity,</l>
<l n="1427"> The stepmother of Hospitality,</l>
<l n="1428"> The adversary of Truth,</l>
<l n="1429"> The nurse of Cruelty,</l>
<l n="1430"> Mother of all iniquity.</l>
<l n="1431"> This is a woman who loves only herself.</l>
<l n="1432"> She pretends to have love for whomever</l>
<l n="1433"> She can profit from,</l>
<l n="1434"> Otherwise nobody can please her.</l>
<l n="1435"> And when her advantage has run out,</l>
<l n="1436"> She hates him and does not care for him.</l>
<l n="1437"> About this woman, I say with certainty</l>
<l n="1438"> That she only loves herself. </l>
<l n="1439"> For she—know this—has such a manner</l>
<l n="1440"> That she considers everyone base and herself extremely worthy.</l>
<l n="1441"> She loves her body and takes good care of it,</l>
<l n="1442"> Her attention turned towards carnal delights,</l>
<l n="1443"> And her refined pleasures,</l>
<l n="1444"> And towards sharp and lively ruse.</l>
<l n="1445"> She is pretty and does not care for her soul.</l>
<l n="1446"> She leads the life of a dissolute woman,</l>
<l n="1447"> For it seems to her too difficult</l>
<l n="1448"> To love God and her neighbor.</l>
<l n="1449"> Although she pretends to often,</l>
<l n="1450"> —But, nevertheless, only when</l>
<l n="1451"> She does not put her heart or her desire into it.</l>
<l n="1452"> Never did a wise man put his trust in her!</l>
<l n="1453"> For this reason, I think David says</l>
<l n="1454"> That we should never trust princes</l>
<l n="1455"> Or the sons of this fleshly mud</l>
<l n="1456"> In whom there is no salvation.</l>
<l n="1457"> Carnality, who is so crazy</l>
<l n="1458"> That she flees reason and her school</l>
<l n="1459"> Does not attach any importance to others’ chastisements,</l>
<l n="1460"> Nor does she like those who tell her what is good for her.</l>
<l n="1461"> She is of such a noble heart</l>
<l n="1462"> That she only loves those of her lineage.</l>
<l n="1463"> Never will she be courteous</l>
<l n="1464"> Except to whomever is</l>
<l n="1465"> Her nephew, cousin or relative.</l>
<l n="1466"> Through her, they often receive income</l>
<l n="1467"> And obtain many benefits,</l>
<l n="1468"> The children, and those who are full of vice.</l>
<l n="1469"> The prelates and the upper classes</l>
<l n="1470"> Are too vilely bogged down in this sin.</l>
<l n="1471"> They do not love anyone but their relatives!</l>
<l n="1472"> Fauvel has put so much of his own kind there</l>
<l n="1473"> That there is no charity there.</l>
<l n="1474"> For they do this for posterity,</l>
<l n="1475"> To have a record after death,</l>
<l n="1476"> Of their life of vainglory.</l>
<l n="1477"> But these people will have no importance.</l>
<l n="1478"> When they die, they will lack all of their belongings!</l>
<l n="1479"> Carnality is the nurse</l>
<l n="1480"> Of Fauvel, in whom there is so much vice.</l>
<l n="1481"> Carnality nourishes him</l>
<l n="1482"> With her breast, which is completely rotten,</l>
<l n="1483"> And for this reason, Fauvel is full of excrement,</l>
<l n="1484"> And his end will be decay.</l>
<l n="1485"> And of this carnality,</l>
<l n="1486"> The apostle tells us truly</l>
<l n="1487"> That in the end of the fleshly world</l>
<l n="1488"> In which all evil abounds and lives </l>
<l n="1489"> The people who will be alive then</l>
<l n="1490"> Will only love themselves</l>
<l n="1491"> For each one will be so taken with the flesh</l>
<l n="1492"> That he will only love himself.</l>
<l n="1493"> Then, there will be no charity,</l>
<l n="1494"> Which comes from two sides.</l>
<l n="1495"> Carnality, who distributes the bone</l>
<l n="1496"> Holds it all to one side</l>
<l n="1497"> —She gives out the bone and the meager bits</l>
<l n="1498"> But she insists on keeping the fat,</l>
<l n="1499"> So that she creates throughout the nations</l>
<l n="1500"> Quarrels and disputes.</l>
<l n="1501"> Seated next to Carnality</l>
<l n="1502"> Was, it seems to me, Covetousness,</l>
<l n="1503"> Who has very evil intentions.</l>
<l n="1504"> She was thin, dry, gray and pale</l>
<l n="1505"> But she was not so abnormal</l>
<l n="1506"> That she did not have a chest full of deniers.</l>
<l n="1507"> For she is at war night and day</l>
<l n="1508"> To have more and to acquire more.</l>
<l n="1509"> She has thrown her life into great misery,</l>
<l n="1510"> For nothing is ever enough for her.</l>
<l n="1511"> If she were queen of France</l>
<l n="1512"> She would not have enough,</l>
<l n="1513"> Rather she would suffer great pains</l>
<l n="1514"> To obtain the Empire!</l>
<l n="1515"> Every day she pushes and pulls in order to have more,</l>
<l n="1516"> And, the more she has, the worse she becomes.</l>
<l n="1517"> Next to her is Avarice</l>
<l n="1518"> Who differs from the other vices</l>
<l n="1519"> In that the longer she lives, the younger she becomes.</l>
<l n="1520"> All those who are alive know this.</l>
<l n="1521"> She does not get older with old age,</l>
<l n="1522"> Which attacks all of the other vices.</l>
<l n="1523"> And the Holy Scripture says</l>
<l n="1524"> That she is the root of all evils,</l>
<l n="1525"> And that in her company are</l>
<l n="1526"> Servitude and Idolatry.</l>
<l n="1527"> And then afterwards was seated Envy</l>
<l n="1528"> Who does not hate Lord Fauvel.</l>
<l n="1529"> It is she who cannot say anything nice</l>
<l n="1530"> About anything good.</l>
<l n="1531"> She has directed all of her desire</l>
<l n="1532"> Towards mourning the successes of others</l>
<l n="1533"> And rejoicing in their pain.</l>
<l n="1534"> Her eyes are covered with a veil</l>
<l n="1535"> So that she does not see clearly.</l>
<l n="1536"> She does not make any accurate judgments,</l>
<l n="1537"> And it is a shame that she sees nothing!</l>
<l n="1538"> But she hears very clearly and listens</l>
<l n="1539"> To bad news very willingly</l>
<l n="1540"> And reports it everywhere.</l>
<l n="1541"> She rides faster than any Frisian horse</l>
<l n="1542"> When she is concocting a treacherous plan.</l>
<l n="1543"> After was seated Calumny</l>
<l n="1544"> Who is of vile extraction,</l>
<l n="1545"> For she is the daughter of Evil Mouth,</l>
<l n="1546"> Who rises early and goes to bed late,</l>
<l n="1547"> In order to speak ill in fields and cities.</l>
<l n="1548"> She is constantly unraveling or spinning evil,</l>
<l n="1549"> Calumny, who steals good reputations.</l>
<l n="1550"> She resembles her mother completely</l>
<l n="1551"> For she does not enjoy anything</l>
<l n="1552"> As much as blaming or defaming people,</l>
<l n="1553"> Nor can she suffer that anyone say</l>
<l n="1554"> Anything good about someone alive.</l>
<l n="1555"> And, moreover, she often bites him,</l>
<l n="1556"> Gnaws at him, tugs at him, kicks him and sinks her teeth in:</l>
<l n="1557"> She is the poisonous leech</l>
<l n="1558"> That sucks good reputation;</l>
<l n="1559"> She is the serpentine tongue</l>
<l n="1560"> That never tires of spitting venom;</l>
<l n="1561"> And she can never sufficiently belch</l>
<l n="1562"> So that she can evacuate the totality,</l>
<l n="1563"> And the more she gnaws at and devours people,</l>
<l n="1564"> The more venom resides in her body.</l>
<l n="1565"> It is better to be struck by a sword</l>
<l n="1566"> Than by such a poisonous tongue!</l>
<l n="1567"> After this was seated Hatred</l>
<l n="1568"> Who is inclined to do all evil.</l>
<l n="1569"> And afterwards was seated Resentment</l>
<l n="1570"> Who is very common in many people.</l>
<l n="1571"> It is she who is so cruel</l>
<l n="1572"> That she endures for a long time in the heart</l>
<l n="1573"> And often does not undo her evil wishes</l>
<l n="1574"> No matter what kind of resolution one makes,</l>
<l n="1575"> Rather she constantly gnaws at the thorn,</l>
<l n="1576"> So that she never wants to forgive</l>
<l n="1577"> At any cost, whether for life or death.</l>
<l n="1578"> But know that she will never find</l>
<l n="1579"> Forgiveness, unless she wants to give it.</l>
<l n="1580"> It is in vain that they will ring the bells </l>
<l n="1581"> After her death, or sing a mass.</l>
<l n="1582"> She will receive her just deserts in hell.</l>
<l n="1583"> And afterwards was seated Sadness</l>
<l n="1584"> Who does not rejoice in anything good.</l>
<l n="1585"> And afterwards was seated Anger</l>
<l n="1586"> Who never knew how to act according to reason,</l>
<l n="1587"> And is guided instead by impatience,</l>
<l n="1588"> And always arrives at the worst judgment.</l>
<l n="1589"> Afterwards, as I have heard described,</l>
<l n="1590"> Was Lazy-to-do-Well.</l>
<l n="1591"> Near her was Leisure</l>
<l n="1592"> Who is always dangerous.</l>
<l n="1593"> Afterwards was seated Venus</l>
<l n="1594"> Who catches people clothed or naked.</l>
<l n="1595"> This is the natural sin</l>
<l n="1596"> Which is always an apple,</l>
<l n="1597"> As long as old age, sickness or reason</l>
<l n="1598"> Have not made it go out of season.</l>
<l n="1599"> In close proximity was Gluttony</l>
<l n="1600"> Who was black and lethargic from having overeaten.</l>
<l n="1601"> Then Drunkenness and Lechery</l>
<l n="1602"> Who never, in all of their lives,</l>
<l n="1603"> Knew how to fast or eat at the right time.</l>
<l n="1604"> Their children died, completely drunk.</l>
<l n="1605"> But next to Fauvel, to his left,</l>
<l n="1606"> I saw Pride, in great pomp,</l>
<l n="1607"> And then Presumption,</l>
<l n="1608"> Disdain and Indignation,</l>
<l n="1609"> Vain Flirtation and then Ostentation,</l>
<l n="1610"> Arrogance and Crazy Overconfidence.</l>
<l n="1611"> Afterwards was seated Hypocrisy,</l>
<l n="1612"> Who is very humble on the outside</l>
<l n="1613"> But in her heart, with great mastery,</l>
<l n="1614"> Conforms to Pride and his followers.</l>
<l n="1615"> She is a marvelous woman.</l>
<l n="1616"> Sometimes she is dressed as a nun,</l>
<l n="1617"> In a habit, and then as a secular woman,</l>
<l n="1618"> Then as a Franciscan monk, then a Franciscan nun,</l>
<l n="1619"> Then as a Dominican monk, then as a Dominican nun,</l>
<l n="1620"> Sometimes a lady, another a young girl,</l>
<l n="1621"> And then as a lord, and then as a servant.</l>
<l n="1622"> She has many strings in her bow.</l>
<l n="1623"> She pulls on one and then the other.</l>
<l n="1624"> Sometimes she praises, and sometimes she disparages.</l>
<l n="1625"> In front of people she prays and murmurs,</l>
<l n="1626"> But in her heart she has a little fox.</l>
<l n="1627"> She knows well, in times of peace and war,</l>
<l n="1628"> How to make fun of God!</l>
<l n="1629"> False Seeming was seated next to her,</l>
<l n="1630"> But about neither of them</l>
<l n="1631"> Would I like to speak longer,</l>
<l n="1632"> For in them, there is no good.</l>
<l n="1633"> And whoever would like to know how to gloss them</l>
<l n="1634"> Should consult the Romance of the rose.</l>
<l n="1635"> Afterwards was seated Inconstancy,</l>
<l n="1636"> Who had thrown onto her back</l>
<l n="1637"> A cloak lined with panther fur</l>
<l n="1638"> Made out of changing material. </l>
<l n="1639"> And this figure, who is always changing,</l>
<l n="1640"> Is always dressed in things that change:</l>
<l n="1641"> She says one thing, but in action</l>
<l n="1642"> She is nothing but the opposite,</l>
<l n="1643"> And through her beautiful behavior</l>
<l n="1644"> She is called Inconstancy.</l>
<l n="1645"> Next was seated Duplicity</l>
<l n="1646"> Who always directs her attention</l>
<l n="1647"> Towards doublespeak</l>
<l n="1648"> Or language with a double meaning.</l>
<l n="1649"> Next to her, Falsity had her seat,</l>
<l n="1650"> Which is falser than cork.</l>
<l n="1651"> In her one thinks one will find some goodness,</l>
<l n="1652"> But she is disloyal and empty.</l>
<l n="1653"> Next to her was seated Ingratitude</l>
<l n="1654"> Who is very bad and disagreeable,</l>
<l n="1655"> For she does not want to recognize</l>
<l n="1656"> Whoever might have exerted effort in helping her.</l>
<l n="1657"> May she be condemned in all courts,</l>
<l n="1658"> For she was born under a bad star! </l>
<l n="1659"> Next to her was seated Baseness</l>
<l n="1660"> In the clothing of knighthood;</l>
<l n="1661"> But towards knowing true nobility</l>
<l n="1662"> She does put or direct her heart.</l>
<l n="1663"> But if she were the daughter of a good father,</l>
<l n="1664"> It would be fitting that some good quality appear in her!</l>
<l n="1665"> She believes she is noble and wise</l>
<l n="1666"> Because she has a great inheritance</l>
<l n="1667"> But she deceives herself and errs,</l>
<l n="1668"> For nobility is not of the earth,</l>
<l n="1669"> Rather it is grafted in man through the heart</l>
<l n="1670"> Which is paid with noble qualities.</l>
<l n="1671"> Those in whom they are present</l>
<l n="1672"> Are very noble and well mannered.</l>
<l n="1673"> About the nobleman, I declare and will declare</l>
<l n="1674"> That he is born of bad blood,</l>
<l n="1675"> Or born in the sin of adultery,</l>
<l n="1676"> If he does not equip and provide himself with</l>
<l n="1677"> Noble actions, through which one can say</l>
<l n="1678"> That it was no peasant who gave birth to him.</l>
<l n="1679"> And afterwards was seated Anxiety</l>
<l n="1680"> Who is not lazy about working,</l>
<l n="1681"> For on Sundays and feast days,</l>
<l n="1682"> She makes servants and animals work.</l>
<l n="1683"> She has such great haste to work</l>
<l n="1684"> That she does not care about honoring God.</l>
<l n="1685"> And even if she did not have a child or wife,</l>
<l n="1686"> She would still want to act this way.</l>
<l n="1687"> Know that he was born under a bad star,</l>
<l n="1688"> Whoever works in this way.</l>
<l n="1689"> Both testaments</l>
<l n="1690"> Forbid it, may God help me!</l>
<l n="1691"> Around the lord who is tawny</l>
<l n="1692"> There was—may Christ save me—</l>
<l n="1693"> An abundance of people from his household.</l>
<l n="1694"> There was a great crowd there.</l>
<l n="1695"> There was Deceit, [?],</l>
<l n="1696"> Traitor, Scheming, Trickery</l>
<l n="1697"> Murder, Treason, Robbery,</l>
<l n="1698"> And even Perjury and False Promise.</l>
<l n="1699"> They were mounted on the ladder</l>
<l n="1700"> To see Fauvel, whom they loved.</l>
<l n="1701"> Debauchery was also there,</l>
<l n="1702"> And Risk, whom God renounces,</l>
<l n="1703"> Heresy and Sodomy,</l>
<l n="1704"> And all types of dangerous life.</l>
<l n="1705"> Around the hall, near the pillars,</l>
<l n="1706"> They were there in heaps and bounds,</l>
<l n="1707"> Near Fauvel and his throne.</l>
<l n="1708"> Fauvel did not remain silent.</l>
<l n="1709"> He held a little baton of elder.</l>
<l n="1710"> It did not appear that he had a cold;</l>
<l n="1711"> He speaks loudly. This is his theme:</l>
<l n="1712"> "Lords and ladies who are here,</l>
<l n="1713"> You must be joyful and hold parties,</l>
<l n="1714"> For you are in my household,</l>
<l n="1715"> And are all a part of my lineage.</l>
<l n="1716"> And you see that our business</l>
<l n="1717"> Is going so well that it must please you.</l>
<l n="1718"> Today, I am king and lord</l>
<l n="1719"> Of both the kingdom and the empire,</l>
<l n="1720"> And you see everyone aspire</l>
<l n="1721"> To serve me and care for me.</l>
<l n="1722"> There is neither prelate nor clerk nor priest</l>
<l n="1723"> Who does not wish to be near me,</l>
<l n="1724"> And all of the worldly princes</l>
<l n="1725"> Rub Fauvel better than Morel!</l>
<l n="1726"> You see few people who do not have nice clothing</l>
<l n="1727"> If they do not rub or pet or flatter me.</l>
<l n="1728"> I have rubbed so much, and been so rubbed,</l>
<l n="1729"> That everyone has become stupid because of me.</l>
<l n="1730"> I have behaved so subtly</l>
<l n="1731"> And so maliciously</l>
<l n="1732"> That I do not know how many steps I have taken</l>
<l n="1733"> To the great position to which I have climbed.</l>
<l n="1734"> I did not come through a straight path,</l>
<l n="1735"> Since I did not know how to climb that way.</l>
<l n="1736"> The straight path is too difficult for me,</l>
<l n="1737"> While the winding one seems good and short to me!</l>
<l n="1738"> I will never take the right path,</l>
<l n="1739"> Nor will I go there or come through it.</l>
<l n="1740"> I have done so much—this you can see—</l>
<l n="1741"> That I can sit with great pomp.</l>
<l n="1742"> I have trampled Reason down,</l>
<l n="1743"> I do not fear her or care for her anymore!</l>
<l n="1744"> My enemies have been expelled</l>
<l n="1745"> And my friends are strong and feared.</l>
<l n="1746"> I turn upside down, as it pleases me completely,</l>
<l n="1747"> The world, which loves me very much and holds me in high regard. </l>
<l n="1748"> There is no one who can hurt me anymore.</l>
<l n="1749"> Whatever I undertake, I know how to finish it.</l>
<l n="1750"> Everything comes to me as much as I desire.</l>
<l n="1751"> I am very rich and have a good income</l>
<l n="1752"> Through my wisdom and my deception.</l>
<l n="1753"> I have the good grace of Fortune,</l>
<l n="1754"> Who turns according to my desire.</l>
<l n="1755"> She gave me great power</l>
<l n="1756"> Over the world, which is her house.</l>
<l n="1757"> She made me lord in spite of Reason,</l>
<l n="1758"> But I greatly fear one thing,</l>
<l n="1759"> Which I do not dare reveal except to you,</l>
<l n="1760"> And you must remain vigilant</l>
<l n="1761"> In loving and advising me!</l>
<l n="1762"> I see that Fortune is changeable,</l>
<l n="1763"> And a very fearsome lady.</l>
<l n="1764"> Because she always wants to be new,</l>
<l n="1765"> I fear that she will make a move against me</l>
<l n="1766"> In order to throw me from my position.</l>
<l n="1767"> Now I will tell you my secret,</l>
<l n="1768"> Which I have thought about in great depth,</l>
<l n="1769"> In order to be sure that it is firmly founded—</l>
<l n="1770"> So that no man can do harm</l>
<l n="1771"> To the excellence of my high position.</l>
<l n="1772"> You know that I do not have a wife.</l>
<l n="1773"> It would be necessary that I wed some woman</l>
<l n="1774"> Who pleases me well,</l>
<l n="1775"> So as to be able to multiply myself.</l>
<l n="1776"> Thus, through reproduction,</l>
<l n="1777"> In a permanent succession</l>
<l n="1778"> Of sons, nephews and nieces,</l>
<l n="1779"> Who would have a part</l>
<l n="1780"> Of my intelligence and my nature,</l>
<l n="1781"> Human creation</l>
<l n="1782"> Would be completely surrounded with my heirs</l>
<l n="1783"> In order to make it live according to my desires.</l>
<l n="1784"> Now, I have also thought</l>
<l n="1785"> About Fortune, who distributes everything,</l>
<l n="1786"> That she cannot not love me,</l>
<l n="1787"> Since she gives me such great honors,</l>
<l n="1788"> And since she has given me such great power,</l>
<l n="1789"> And that it cannot be otherwise</l>
<l n="1790"> Since she has given me, without deception,</l>
<l n="1791"> Her love and her grace.</l>
<l n="1792"> And she is not married,</l>
<l n="1793"> And neither am I, I who desire her;</l>
<l n="1794"> And I think, if someone were to speak to her,</l>
<l n="1795"> That she would agree to this idea very quickly.</l>
<l n="1796"> And if I were to marry her,</l>
<l n="1797"> I would be master of her wheel.</l>
<l n="1798"> The lady would be in my dominion,</l>
<l n="1799"> And she would turn according to my wishes.</l>
<l n="1800"> My good luck would be assured,</l>
<l n="1801"> And I would be able to sleep soundly.</l>
<l n="1802"> Even though women are disposed</l>
<l n="1803"> To loving what they desire,</l>
<l n="1804"> It is not the custom in any land</l>
<l n="1805"> That they make the first move.</l>
<l n="1806"> But the will, which is often fickle,</l>
<l n="1807"> Often shows the manner in a woman</l>
<l n="1808"> Through which she is often the first</l>
<l n="1809"> To set the process in motion through which she is asked.</l>
<l n="1810"> And when she shows this desire,</l>
<l n="1811"> Through signs, or words, or actions,</l>
<l n="1812"> She holds in great disdain</l>
<l n="1813"> Whoever delays in acting.</l>
<l n="1814"> Thus Fortune, who takes away everything,</l>
<l n="1815"> Is in her customs completely feminine.</l>
<l n="1816"> And for this reason, if you counsel it,</l>
<l n="1817"> I would be very ready</l>
<l n="1818"> To ask her and beg her</l>
<l n="1819"> That she marry me.”</l>
<l n="1820"> Without considering reason or law,</l>
<l n="1821"> The council responds without delay:</l>
<l n="1822"> “Sir Fauvel, noble emperor,</l>
<l n="1823"> You must sit on the thrown</l>
<l n="1824"> And govern the whole empire,</l>
<l n="1825"> For nothing can compare to your intelligence.</l>
<l n="1826"> Your genius rises above and surpasses everything,</l>
<l n="1827"> However much this displeases Reason, the poor thing,</l>
<l n="1828"> Or Loyalty or Truth.</l>
<l n="1829"> You have placed the whole world beneath your feet,</l>
<l n="1830"> And your majesty is sovereign</l>
<l n="1831"> Above all human virtue.</l>
<l n="1832"> Good manners and fortuitous events</l>
<l n="1833"> Have fled towards the west</l>
<l n="1834"> To islands that no one inhabits.</l>
<l n="1835"> You have, through your quarrels,</l>
<l n="1836"> Conquered them, removed them from your path,</l>
<l n="1837"> And then sent them into exile.</l>
<l n="1838"> Even the cardinal virtues</l>
<l n="1839"> Have their shields full of holes,</l>
<l n="1840"> For you have pierced them with your sword.</l>
<l n="1841"> They have lost everything in the battle,</l>
<l n="1842"> For you know so much about war.</l>
<l n="1843"> You must reign over the whole earth!</l>
<l n="1844"> The very great wisdom that we hear from you,</l>
<l n="1845"> Lord, we value and praise very much,</l>
<l n="1846"> And the idea you have presented</l>
<l n="1847"> Here is very noble,</l>
<l n="1848"> [And will] fortify your high rank</l>
<l n="1849"> Everywhere, both here and overseas.</l>
<l n="1850"> You have exposed your heart for us</l>
<l n="1851"> And revealed your great secret,</l>
<l n="1852"> And even though we are felonious,</l>
<l n="1853"> It is right that we hide it,</l>
<l n="1854"> For if we are false towards others,</l>
<l n="1855"> We are nevertheless your vassals,</l>
<l n="1856"> And your servants, and your friends.</l>
<l n="1857"> Each one of us has always exerted</l>
<l n="1858"> And will always exert effort to serve you</l>
<l n="1859"> And to give you worldly honor,</l>
<l n="1860"> For this is something that is important to you.</l>
<l n="1861"> And for this reason we will direct out hearts and words towards it,</l>
<l n="1862"> For we do not look for anything except obtaining</l>
<l n="1863"> Honor in the world and great wealth.</l>
<l n="1864"> It does not matter to us if we lose our souls</l>
<l n="1865"> In joining your service.</l>
<l n="1866"> It seems to us a very worthy task</l>
<l n="1867"> That you immediately and without delay</l>
<l n="1868"> Direct your efforts towards the aforementioned marriage,</l>
<l n="1869"> Which your noble heart has envisaged.</l>
<l n="1870"> As many as there are of us, we approve it,</l>
<l n="1871"> For we see consider it to be a great honor.”</l>
<l n="1872"> When Fauvel had heard</l>
<l n="1873"> His council, he rejoiced greatly</l>
<l n="1874"> For he is always very happy</l>
<l n="1875"> When he hears something that pleases him.</l>
<l n="1876"> He immediately orders that his equipment</l>
<l n="1877"> Be packed up in order to depart</l>
<l n="1878"> For Fortune, the mistress of chance.</l>
<l n="1879"> He girds his sword and puts on his boots,</l>
<l n="1880"> And he does not forget his spurs.</l>
<l n="1881"> Then he leaves with a big crowd</l>
<l n="1882"> Of his followers and his friends.</l>
<l n="1883"> He put so much effort into traveling</l>
<l n="1884"> By both day and night</l>
<l n="1885"> With great enterprise and only brief breaks</l>
<l n="1886"> That he arrived in Macrocosm,</l>
<l n="1887"> A phantasmagorical city,</l>
<l n="1888"> Which was created long ago for the man,</l>
<l n="1889"> Whom Reason calls microcosm.</l>
<l n="1890"> This is where she used to have her home,</l>
<l n="1891"> This most-esteemed lady,</l>
<l n="1892"> Who makes everything turn quickly—</l>
<l n="1893"> This is Fortune, who is feared.</l>
<l n="1894"> She was in her palace, not seated,</l>
<l n="1895"> In order to be able to see everywhere.</l>
<l n="1896"> She never sits down or stops,</l>
<l n="1897"> For she is always ready to turn.</l>
<l n="1898"> Know that he would be a very good mason,</l>
<l n="1899"> Whoever would be able to describe to tell</l>
<l n="1900"> The full truth of its construction!</l>
<l n="1901"> I want to tell you a little bit about it now</l>
<l n="1902"> So that you will know how it appeared</l>
<l n="1903"> When Lord Fauvel, who advances quickly,</l>
<l n="1904"> Came to find Lady Fortune</l>
<l n="1905"> In order to request her love.</l>
<l n="1906"> Fortune had the appearance of a woman</l>
<l n="1907"> Who was a queen or a great lady,</l>
<l n="1908"> And it seemed, to judge from her face,</l>
<l n="1909"> That her heart changed very rapidly.</l>
<l n="1910"> She had a beautiful and well-made body</l>
<l n="1911"> And her limbs were long and well proportioned.</l>
<l n="1912"> In her hand she held a double crown.</l>
<l n="1913"> One appeared evil and the other good.</l>
<l n="1914"> And the one that seemed good</l>
<l n="1915"> Was not empty—as it seemed to be—</l>
<l n="1916"> Of beautiful, precious stones,</l>
<l n="1917"> Very pleasant to behold.</l>
<l n="1918"> Rather, there were many</l>
<l n="1919"> That did not seem good or beautiful,</l>
<l n="1920"> Rather, they seemed to be little crapaudine [INSERT NOTE],</l>
<l n="1921"> Which prick in the same way as thorns,</l>
<l n="1922"> As far as the heart, under the shirt.</l>
<l n="1923"> But it is difficult to realize</l>
<l n="1924"> Except for those who wear the crown</l>
<l n="1925"> When Fortune abandons them.</l>
<l n="1926"> The other crown, which appeared to be evil,</l>
<l n="1927"> Is vile, filthy and dirty</l>
<l n="1928"> And is made out of a very piercing metal.</l>
<l n="1929"> Whoever wears it has no desire to sing</l>
<l n="1930"> Or to appear happy,</l>
<l n="1931"> For this crown is very unpleasant.</l>
<l n="1932"> Nevertheless, on the inside are hidden</l>
<l n="1933"> Small green emeralds</l>
<l n="1934"> Which are like small grains of sand,</l>
<l n="1935"> Since they cannot be perceived</l>
<l n="1936"> Except by the poor people who wear them,</l>
<l n="1937"> Who find comfort in their discomfort.</l>
<l n="1938"> These two crowns held</l>
<l n="1939"> Fortune, for whom this was very fitting.</l>
<l n="1940"> But she had a truly hideous face.</l>
<l n="1941"> I do not know anyone—familiar or wild—</l>
<l n="1942"> Who has such a face as Fortune!</l>
<l n="1943"> One side is dark and brown</l>
<l n="1944"> And is hideous to behold,</l>
<l n="1945"> And the other is beautiful and full of grace,</l>
<l n="1946"> Tender, white, bright and pink.</l>
<l n="1947"> She does not appear to be a mournful woman,</l>
<l n="1948"> When one sees her from that angle,</l>
<l n="1949"> But from the other side she looks like a leopard,</l>
<l n="1950"> Full of pain, cruel and ferocious,</l>
<l n="1951"> And always ready to strike.</l>
<l n="1952"> One of her eyes is red and burning,</l>
<l n="1953"> Cruel and horrible in its gaze</l>
<l n="1954"> And it sits on the left side of her face.</l>
<l n="1955"> But her right eye is sparkling and lively</l>
<l n="1956"> So that those who are caught in her gaze</l>
<l n="1957"> Are taken by surprise and deceived.</l>
<l n="1958"> She had a dress divided in two,</l>
<l n="1959"> Fortune, with one part</l>
<l n="1960"> Made of samite, and not of wool,</l>
<l n="1961"> Such that it changed color.</l>
<l n="1962"> The other part was made of an old piece of serge,</l>
<l n="1963"> With which Fortune is courteous and generous,</l>
<l n="1964"> For she distributes segments and pieces</l>
<l n="1965"> To whomever goes past her.</l>
<l n="1966"> There were two wheels in front of Fortune</l>
<l n="1967"> Which constantly turned, but one</l>
<l n="1968"> Went fast and the other slowly</l>
<l n="1969"> And in each one, truly,</l>
<l n="1970"> There was a smaller wheel</l>
<l n="1971"> Placed on the inside and in such a way</l>
<l n="1972"> That it had a movement contrary</l>
<l n="1973"> To the wheel in which it was placed.</l>
<l n="1974"> Without stopping, these wheels</l>
<l n="1975"> Make the state of the world turn.</l>
<l n="1976"> Fortune takes much pleasure in this game.</l>
<l n="1977"> She flatters some and beats others,</l>
<l n="1978"> For with each turn she makes,</l>
<l n="1979"> She destroys some and revives others.</l>
<l n="1980"> To some she offers her crown,</l>
<l n="1981"> Then takes it away, then gives it back,</l>
<l n="1982"> Sometimes she is good and sometimes bad.</l>
<l n="1983"> In this way she distributes joy and suffering.</l>
<l n="1984"> In this way, no man can know</l>
<l n="1985"> How much bad or good he might have,</l>
<l n="1986"> For Fortune has everywhere thrown her will</l>
<l n="1987"> To the wind.</l>
<l n="1988"> At her feet was seated Vainglory,</l>
<l n="1989"> Who directed all of her attention</l>
<l n="1990"> Towards preparing herself beautifully</l>
<l n="1991"> So that those who rise up on the wheel</l>
<l n="1992"> Would look at her, as if in a mirror.</l>
<l n="1993"> With her noble manners, she invites them</l>
<l n="1994"> To pay attention to her and watch her so much</l>
<l n="1995"> That they do not think about the fall</l>
<l n="1996"> Coming through the turn of the wheels</l>
<l n="1997"> That occurs when Fortune kicks them.</l>
<l n="1998"> In this state was Fortune</l>
<l n="1999"> When Fauvel, with his entourage,</l>
<l n="2000"> Arrived in Macrocosm.</l>
<l n="2001"> He knew that Fortune was there, so he went immediately,</l>
<l n="2002"> And when he saw her majesty,</l>
<l n="2003"> He stopped at a bit of a distance.</l>
<l n="2004"> If he was afraid, it is no wonder!</l>
<l n="2005"> Nevertheless, he prepares himself very well</l>
<l n="2006"> To speak wisely,</l>
<l n="2007"> Humbly genuflected,</l>
<l n="2008"> Like someone who knows his craft well,</l>
<l n="2009"> He greets the lady Fortune</l>
<l n="2010"> And then began his task</l>
<l n="2011"> Of speaking to her in this way:</l>
<l n="2012"> “My lady, may the great lord</l>
<l n="2013"> Who does not have an equal or superior</l>
<l n="2014"> Grant you a long and happy life</l>
<l n="2015"> And may he maintain your high position!</l>
<l n="2016"> The great desire that I had</l>
<l n="2017"> To see you put me on your path</l>
<l n="2018"> And gave me the courage to come her.</l>
<l n="2019"> I could not stay away!</l>
<l n="2020"> I would have been considered a lunatic or a fool</l>
<l n="2021"> If I had not had a great desire</l>
<l n="2022"> To see you, my dear lady,</l>
<l n="2023"> To whom I give my body and soul.</l>
<l n="2024"> I must do this, for you know</l>
<l n="2025"> That I am as you have made me.</l>
<l n="2026"> I am your creature, completely,</l>
<l n="2027"> Your servant, the product of your craft.</l>
<l n="2028"> I could not describe</l>
<l n="2029"> The state to which you have made me rise.</l>
<l n="2030"> I could not count the number</l>
<l n="2031"> Of honors that I have in your shadow!</l>
<l n="2032"> You have left me all of your rewards without merit,</l>
<l n="2033"> This is clear.</l>
<l n="2034"> And for this reason I came to you</l>
<l n="2035"> To offer myself to you as a debtor.</l>
<l n="2036"> I am your servant and your liegeman.</l>
<l n="2037"> I beg you, lady, as</l>
<l n="2038"> One who is my sovereign,</l>
<l n="2039"> May it not be a trouble or inconvenience</l>
<l n="2040"> That I have so boldly decided</l>
<l n="2041"> To come see you in this way.</l>
<l n="2042"> For, my lady, I am considering</l>
<l n="2043"> The rewards that it pleases you to give me.</l>
<l n="2044"> You have made me king and lord</l>
<l n="2045"> Of the kingdom and the empire.</l>
<l n="2046"> There is neither prince nor prelate in the Church</l>
<l n="2047"> Who does not honor me and love and value me.</l>
<l n="2048"> There is no longer anyone, great or small,</l>
<l n="2049"> Who does not have the desire and appetite</l>
<l n="2050"> To do me a favor,</l>
<l n="2051"> Through which he might obtain my good graces.</l>
<l n="2052"> Through you I am rich and powerful.</l>
<l n="2053"> To me all are obedient.</l>
<l n="2054"> Today, all are ready</l>
<l n="2055"> To bow down before my majesty.</l>
<l n="2056"> I am honored as a God on earth</l>
<l n="2057"> In all places, whether in peace or in war</l>
<l n="2058"> As long as I remain in your favor.</l>
<l n="2059"> You are my life and my joy!</l>
<l n="2060"> Your sweet appearance has set me on fire,</l>
<l n="2061"> For I feel in my heart the spark</l>
<l n="2062"> Of Love, which heats me and freezes me.</l>
<l n="2063"> From love of your worth,</l>
<l n="2064"> I feel in my heart a great heat,</l>
<l n="2065"> But fear of losing your good graces,</l>
<l n="2066"> Has often made me as cold as ice.</l>
<l n="2067"> For you know, lady, that love</l>
<l n="2068"> Is contrary to life and to death,</l>
<l n="2069"> For in it, it proposes and opposes,</l>
<l n="2070"> It creates suffering more than it rests,</l>
<l n="2071"> Sometimes it holds great hope</l>
<l n="2072"> Of obtaining what one desires.</l>
<l n="2073"> Other times it creates despair of everything,</l>
<l n="2074"> Because it [creates] fear of falling.</l>
<l n="2075"> A very contrary disputation,</l>
<l n="2076"> Love leads in all seasons!</l>
<l n="2077"> He or she whom love masters,</l>
<l n="2078"> No longer has control over themselves.</l>
<l n="2079"> And because love controls me,</l>
<l n="2080"> I have undertaken this speech.</l>
<l n="2081"> I can no longer hide or remain silent.</l>
<l n="2082"> The strength of love makes me do this!</l>
<l n="2083"> For this reason, god-like lady,</l>
<l n="2084"> May you take pity on me,</l>
<l n="2085"> For true love commands me</l>
<l n="2086"> That I request your love.</l>
<l n="2087"> And love assures me,</l>
<l n="2088"> Since you have taken such great pains</l>
<l n="2089"> To have me honored</l>
<l n="2090"> And exalted and adored.</l>
<l n="2091"> You would certainly have never done this,</l>
<l n="2092"> If you did not love me.</l>
<l n="2093"> Alas! How could I restrain myself</l>
<l n="2094"> From loving you, you who are my joy?</l>
<l n="2095"> And woman, who is of such a sweet nature,</l>
<l n="2096"> That she cannot hate he whom she loves.</l>
<l n="2097"> Rather, feminine nature is</l>
<l n="2098"> Sweet, in and of itself, tender and ready</l>
<l n="2099"> To hear and love whomever</l>
<l n="2100"> Wants to request its love.</l>
<l n="2101"> You have deigned to elevate me so much</l>
<l n="2102"> That there is nothing that might bother me.</l>
<l n="2103"> And when she agrees to listen,</l>
<l n="2104"> She cannot refuse her beseecher.</l>
<l n="2105"> For this reason, my lady, in hopes</l>
<l n="2106"> Of this great reward, if you please,</l>
<l n="2107"> I beg and beseech your love.</l>
<l n="2108"> I do not desire anything more in this world.</l>
<l n="2109"> And so that you not think that I desire</l>
<l n="2110"> Something from which honesty might suffer,</l>
<l n="2111"> And from which a note of baseness</l>
<l n="2112"> Would appear in what I am saying</l>
<l n="2113"> —I would not wish to do this for anything,</l>
<l n="2114"> My sweet, generous lady—,</l>
<l n="2115"> For this reason I want to reveal my whole heart,</l>
<l n="2116"> As long as you are not moved to anger.</l>
<l n="2117"> "Very sweet lady, you know</l>
<l n="2118"> That you possess great wealth.</l>
<l n="2119"> All belongings, money, gold, deniers,</l>
<l n="2120"> Come from nowhere except from your attics.</l>
<l n="2121"> You are queen and lady of the world.</l>
<l n="2122"> Both men and animals,</l>
<l n="2123"> Birds and all mortal things,</l>
<l n="2124"> Are under your power.</l>
<l n="2125"> Therefore it must be very painful to you</l>
<l n="2126"> That you have neither son nor nephew</l>
<l n="2127"> To be the heir of your inheritance—</l>
<l n="2128"> And you are already quite old!</l>
<l n="2129"> You were born a very long time ago</l>
<l n="2130"> And you are not married yet!</l>
<l n="2131"> And, moreover, I am thinking of</l>
<l n="2132"> The fact that you entrusted me with your riches.</l>
<l n="2133"> Because of this, if it would please you to consider</l>
<l n="2134"> Taking me as a husband,</l>
<l n="2135"> Then your goods would be </l>
<l n="2136"> More secure and I would be assuaged,</l>
<l n="2137"> For I would be assured</l>
<l n="2138"> That you won't take away my luck,</l>
<l n="2139"> Since, through your promise you would be mine</l>
<l n="2140"> And I yours; then I would devote myself</l>
<l n="2141"> To loving you, serving and pleasing you,</l>
<l n="2142"> More than a child does his mother!"</l>
<l n="2143"> Then Fauvel fell silent and sighed</l>
<l n="2144"> With one of those fake sighs he masters so well.</l>
<l n="2145"> He truly believes that, by moonlight,</l>
<l n="2146"> He has managed to ensnare Fortune!</l>
<l n="2147"> But it is he who is ensnared</l>
<l n="2148"> By Pride, who mocks him! </l>
<l n="2149"> When Fauvel had fallen silent,</l>
<l n="2150"> Fortune began to respond: </l>
<l n="2151"> She looks at him with great violence,</l>
<l n="2152"> And does not make her words scarce.</l>
<l n="2153"> "Fauvel, you are very crazy and presumptuous,</l>
<l n="2154"> Both in deeds and in actions!</l>
<l n="2155"> Do you think that I take for prowess</l>
<l n="2156"> Your overly-confident audacity?</l>
<l n="2157"> According to a common expression,</l>
<l n="2158"> Fortune helps the audacious,</l>
<l n="2159"> But often foolish audacity</l>
<l n="2160"> Is the occasion for and cause of sadness;</l>
<l n="2161"> And I have helped more foolish audacious people</l>
<l n="2162"> Than overcautious wise men.</l>
<l n="2163"> For wise men fear accidents,</l>
<l n="2164"> While the foolish bound towards them.</l>
<l n="2165"> Do you think you will live forever,</l>
<l n="2166"> In putting yourself at risk in this way?</l>
<l n="2167"> But I think one has never heard spoken</l>
<l n="2168"> Of the level of presumptuousness</l>
<l n="2169"> You have undertaken and conceived!</l>
<l n="2170"> You did not know me well enough!</l>
<l n="2171"> How did it come into your head,</l>
<l n="2172"> To the tippy top and summit,</l>
<l n="2173"> That I might be Lady Maron</l>
<l n="2174"> Who would take Fauvel as a husband?</l>
<l n="2175"> Do you not know what I am capable of,</l>
<l n="2176"> And what games I know how to play?</l>
<l n="2177"> Fauvel, you do not know me at all!</l>
<l n="2178"> No mortal man</l>
<l n="2179"> Ever had full knowledge of me,</l>
<l n="2180"> Nor did he ever know the full extent of my power.</l>
<l n="2181"> Do not think that through wealth</l>
<l n="2182"> My eminence can be known!</l>
<l n="2183"> Rich people do not think about Fortune</l>
<l n="2184"> That she can make two beans one,</l>
<l n="2185"> But when they must become poor,</l>
<l n="2186"> Then they remember Fortune.</l>
<l n="2187"> For this reason, one can know me better through misfortune</l>
<l n="2188"> Than through great fortune.</l>
<l n="2189"> Fauvel, you deceived yourself</l>
<l n="2190"> When you decided </l>
<l n="2191"> That I am the marrying type,</l>
<l n="2192"> And that I would grant you my hand.</l>
<l n="2193"> You do not know me or my mother,</l>
<l n="2194"> Or where I am from, or what</l>
<l n="2195"> I established myself in this world to do.</l>
<l n="2196"> For this reason, I want to make you understand</l>
<l n="2197"> My situation, at least a little,</l>
<l n="2198"> For I see that many who speak of Fortune</l>
<l n="2199"> Often lie,</l>
<l n="2200"> Not knowing whether she is a blonde or a brunette!</l>
<l n="2201"> Fauvel, now abandon your comb</l>
<l n="2202"> And listen to me, for I am the daughter</l>
<l n="2203"> Of the king who, without beginning,</l>
<l n="2204"> Reigns and who lives eternally,</l>
<l n="2205"> And whom Scripture calls</l>
<l n="2206"> The giant of a double nature,</l>
<l n="2207"> For, after he put everything in order,</l>
<l n="2208"> He wanted to be born of pure earth.</l>
<l n="2209"> He was born without the seed of a father,</l>
<l n="2210"> Without the action of man, or a mother.</l>
<l n="2211"> He is the giant who through force</l>
<l n="2212"> Vanquished death in wood without thorns.</l>
<l n="2213"> I was born of this giant.</l>
<l n="2214"> Because of this strong father, I am called "strong" (forte);</l>
<l n="2215"> I am "Fortune", both "one" (une) and "strong" (forte),</l>
<l n="2216"> But I behave differently,</l>
<l n="2217"> And my way of being is double.</l>
<l n="2218"> For some I am beautiful, for others a source of trouble.</l>
<l n="2219"> I am the daughter of the king of kings,</l>
<l n="2220"> Who entrusted to me the world and all of its troubles,</l>
<l n="2221"> Such that I direct</l>
<l n="2222"> Everything, as it pleased my father,</l>
<l n="2223"> For my father, I dare to say it,</l>
<l n="2224"> Does not do anything without reason.</l>
<l n="2225"> Listen, Fauvel, you crazy animal:</l>
<l n="2226"> I have a sister, a little older,</l>
<l n="2227"> Who is called Wisdom.</l>
<l n="2228"> She bears the banner</l>
<l n="2229"> On which virtues are written.</l>
<l n="2230"> All great and small things</l>
<l n="2231"> That existed, exist or will exist</l>
<l n="2232"> Appear clearly on the banner,</l>
<l n="2233"> And not just their appearance,</l>
<l n="2234"> But the entirety of their essence,</l>
<l n="2235"> Each one in its own image,</l>
<l n="2236"> Very clearly illuminated.</l>
<l n="2237"> Whoever contemplates himself in this banner</l>
<l n="2238"> Can see and read everything.</l>
<l n="2239"> Through wisdom he created the world,</l>
<l n="2240"> The king in whom all good resides.</l>
<l n="2241"> Then he took the measure</l>
<l n="2242"> Of the world and of its nature,</l>
<l n="2243"> With wisdom he examined everything</l>
<l n="2244"> That he had made and begun.</l>
<l n="2245"> Wisdom is my full sister.</l>
<l n="2246"> She made the world and I manage it,</l>
<l n="2247"> Through the orders of my father.</l>
<l n="2248"> I make the circle of the world and the sphere</l>
<l n="2249"> Turn without respite.</l>
<l n="2250"> I make night and day arrive.</l>
<l n="2251"> All things related to movement</l>
<l n="2252"> Are under my control.</l>
<l n="2253"> You will be wise if you understand me.</l>
<l n="2254"> Power is mine until the time</l>
<l n="2255"> When all movements will cease.</l>
<l n="2256"> Through me they begin and end,</l>
<l n="2257"> And time is nothing but the measure</l>
<l n="2258"> Of the movements of Nature.</l>
<l n="2259"> Thus you can see how my father</l>
<l n="2260"> Wanted to put me in charge</l>
<l n="2261"> Of all things that move,</l>
<l n="2262"> So that I find myself as their mistress.</l>
<l n="2263"> And for this reason is the world,</l>
<l n="2264"> Which always turns, in my power.</l>
<l n="2265"> I possess time, through which I measure,</l>
<l n="2266"> The speed of the world. </l>
<l n="2267"> Never does it go so fast or slow</l>
<l n="2268"> That I do not draw a point</l>
<l n="2269"> Through which I control</l>
<l n="2270"> The present as well as the past,</l>
<l n="2271"> Even though the present is so small</l>
<l n="2272"> That it cannot be held back.</l>
<l n="2273"> But the aforementioned task</l>
<l n="2274"> Will stop when motion stops,</l>
<l n="2275"> For the world will end</l>
<l n="2276"> As soon as movement ends.</l>
<l n="2277"> But as long as the world endures,</l>
<l n="2278"> It is necessary that I assume the responsibility</l>
<l n="2279"> Of governing and leading it.</l>
<l n="2280"> This is why I can assist or harm,</l>
<l n="2281"> According to the turn I make,</l>
<l n="2282"> In distributing joy and misery.</l>
<l n="2283"> And because I change in this way,</l>
<l n="2284"> I often throw pride down to the ground,</l>
<l n="2285"> And I give hope to the poor,</l>
<l n="2286"> And great comfort in their sort.</l>
<l n="2287"> In order to better summarize my subject,</l>
<l n="2288"> Now I would like to name myself.</l>
<l n="2289"> Listen, animal in whom all evil resides.</l>
<l n="2290"> Fortune is nothing other than</l>
<l n="2291"> Divine providence,</l>
<l n="2292"> Which orders, measures and delimits</l>
<l n="2293"> Through the rule of good reason,</l>
<l n="2294"> The world and its course.</l>
<l n="2295"> Listen, you animal of ill repute!</l>
<l n="2296"> I have at least a four-fold name.</l>
<l n="2297"> My true name is Providence,</l>
<l n="2298"> Which is given to me because</l>
<l n="2299"> I have the power to see far in advance</l>
<l n="2300"> Everything as it must occur.</l>
<l n="2301"> I have always predicted</l>
<l n="2302"> My turn before it was initiated.</l>
<l n="2303"> Without neglect or lack of knowledge,</l>
<l n="2304"> Everything depends on my foresight.</l>
<l n="2305"> My second name is Destiny,</l>
<l n="2306"> Which is sometimes called Fate,</l>
<l n="2307"> Which means, literally,</l>
<l n="2308"> Sent into movement.</l>
<l n="2309"> In as much as I apply myself</l>
<l n="2310"> To moving my true wheel,</l>
<l n="2311"> And am serving this purpose,</l>
<l n="2312"> I merit the name Destiny,</l>
<l n="2313"> For I am the sovereign delegate,</l>
<l n="2314"> And for this reason I also have the name Fate,</l>
<l n="2315"> For through me is said and spoken</l>
<l n="2316"> The secret ordinance of God.</l>
<l n="2317"> My third name is Random Occurrence,</l>
<l n="2318"> Which often comes, painful and hard,</l>
<l n="2319"> Through the course of events that are not known</l>
<l n="2320"> Until the moment when they have occurred.</l>
<l n="2321"> My fourth name is Fortune,</l>
<l n="2322"> For I am strong and I know how to quarrel,</l>
<l n="2323"> And I knock down inside my walls</l>
<l n="2324"> The rich, poor, wise and dumb.</l>
<l n="2325"> Through what has been said, we teach you</l>
<l n="2326"> How Fortune has four names,</l>
<l n="2327"> Like a young maiden</l>
<l n="2328"> Who threw from a high tower</l>
<l n="2329"> Many stones mixed with apples</l>
<l n="2330"> On several women and men</l>
<l n="2331"> And knew</l>
<l n="2332"> How what was thrown would fall.</l>
<l n="2333"> And, since she knew how it would fall,</l>
<l n="2334"> She would have the name Providence.</l>
<l n="2335"> And in as much as she threw the objects,</l>
<l n="2336"> Her name would be Destiny</l>
<l n="2337"> And when people were injured</l>
<l n="2338"> From the stones that fell on them,</l>
<l n="2339"> And the others on whom the apples fell</l>
<l n="2340"> Would not be injured,</l>
<l n="2341"> Through the name of New Accident</l>
<l n="2342"> They would call the lady.</l>
<l n="2343"> And when the common folk would speak</l>
<l n="2344"> Of what happened,</l>
<l n="2345"> The lady would be able to obtain</l>
<l n="2346"> A great reputation and another name,</l>
<l n="2347"> That the lower classes would give her—</l>
<l n="2348"> This would be Fortune.</l>
<l n="2349"> Because I am terrifying,</l>
<l n="2350"> They call me Frightening,</l>
<l n="2351"> And truly this is reasonable,</l>
<l n="2352"> For I am always</l>
<l n="2353"> Worthy of great fear!</l>
<l n="2354"> I am strong and cruel, truly,</l>
<l n="2355"> And whatever I decide to torment</l>
<l n="2356"> Cannot heal or lift itself up</l>
<l n="2357"> Until I decide to take it under my care.</l>
<l n="2358"> And I am tall beyond all measure,</l>
<l n="2359"> Since I can reach the sky,</l>
<l n="2360"> And hold everything in my hand,</l>
<l n="2361"> And my feet reach the earth.</l>
<l n="2362"> I am a lady of peace and war.</l>
<l n="2363"> There is no one who hears someone speak of me</l>
<l n="2364"> Who does not fear me strongly,</l>
<l n="2365"> For through me everything must end,</l>
<l n="2366"> Everything that happens in this world.</l>
<l n="2367"> I grant poverty and wealth,</l>
<l n="2368"> Strength and beauty, joy and sadness...</l>
<l n="2369"> I am a lady, I am a queen,</l>
<l n="2370"> To some I am cruel, to others benign,</l>
<l n="2371"> And I make everyone quickly a neighbor</l>
<l n="2372"> Of that ragged pilgrim</l>
<l n="2373"> Who destroys everything, namely Death.</l>
<l n="2374"> For without respite she bites here and there</l>
<l n="2375"> Such that no man in good fortune</l>
<l n="2376"> Should sleep soundly,</l>
<l n="2377"> Rather he should always be anxious</l>
<l n="2378"> That he not behave so as to displease</l>
<l n="2379"> God, my father, who gives everything,</l>
<l n="2380"> And who repays all things bad and good,</l>
<l n="2381"> Who holds Pride in such hatred,</l>
<l n="2382"> Both her and her relatives,</l>
<l n="2383"> That he cannot suffer her for a long time</l>
<l n="2384"> Without crushing her horribly.</l>
<l n="2385"> Nebuchadnezzar, the king,</l>
<l n="2386"> I will show you as an example,</l>
<l n="2387"> For he was once so drunk</l>
<l n="2388"> Off of the great honors I gave him</l>
<l n="2389"> That he took confidence in his position,</l>
<l n="2390"> And forgot his Creator,</l>
<l n="2391"> And made everyone, through a very foolish action,</l>
<l n="2392"> Worship his image.</l>
<l n="2393"> He did not remember my father,</l>
<l n="2394"> And for this reason he had to face the consequences,</l>
<l n="2395"> For I quickly threw him</l>
<l n="2396"> Into such horrible poverty</l>
<l n="2397"> That he had to go graze with the animals!</l>
<l n="2398"> He had to live naked for seven years.</l>
<l n="2399"> And pride once made the angels</l>
<l n="2400"> Fall out of paradise.</l>
<l n="2401"> And I can prove truly through</l>
<l n="2402"> A great abundance of other examples,</l>
<l n="2403"> Which are long and lengthy to tell,</l>
<l n="2404"> That no man should let Pride grew inside him</l>
<l n="2405"> Or feel resentment,</l>
<l n="2406"> Because he has great fortune</l>
<l n="2407"> In some things in this mortal life,</l>
<l n="2408"> According to the spin of my wheel.</l>
<l n="2409"> For all of this comes from my small wheels,</l>
<l n="2410"> Which are always renewing things,</l>
<l n="2411"> And in which everyone can contemplate himself</l>
<l n="2412"> In order to behave wisely.</l>
<l n="2413"> But it is true that the wise man</l>
<l n="2414"> Has sovereignty over the stars;</l>
<l n="2415"> And this is to say that knowledge</l>
<l n="2416"> Surpasses the influence of planets,</l>
<l n="2417"> Creating a certain disposition</l>
<l n="2418"> On the corporeal complexion.</l>
<l n="2419"> For there is no one, I tell you this truly,</l>
<l n="2420"> Who, if he is inclined towards a vice,</l>
<l n="2421"> Through his natural complexion,</l>
<l n="2422"> According to the constellation</l>
<l n="2423"> Through which he might have that sin,</l>
<l n="2424"> And through which he is more inclined to sin,</l>
<l n="2425"> Who cannot renounce it and refrain,</l>
<l n="2426"> If he lives according to and remains in reason.</l>
<l n="2427"> In the same way, works of charity</l>
<l n="2428"> And prayers of humility</l>
<l n="2429"> When a man or a woman pronounces them</l>
<l n="2430"> In good faith, in front of his Father,</l>
<l n="2431"> Temper the occurrences</l>
<l n="2432"> That would otherwise be too difficult.</l>
<l n="2433"> I will prove it to you through the example of the city of Nineveh,</l>
<l n="2434"> A city about which one finds written</l>
<l n="2435"> That my father decided to strike it</l>
<l n="2436"> And make it quickly perish</l>
<l n="2437"> Because of the great sins</l>
<l n="2438"> That were present there.</l>
<l n="2439"> And Jonah prophesied to them,</l>
<l n="2440"> But the people quickly began to</l>
<l n="2441"> Beg for mercy and cry,</l>
<l n="2442"> To wear hairshirts and to adore God,</l>
<l n="2443"> To fast, both them and their animals,</l>
<l n="2444"> And to cover their heads in ash.</l>
<l n="2445"> And God, who is full of mercy,</l>
<l n="2446"> When he saw their humility,</l>
<l n="2447"> Revoked, in his goodness,</l>
<l n="2448"> The evil that he had planned to do.</l>
<l n="2449"> And also through the King Ezekiel</l>
<l n="2450"> To whom God revealed through Isaiah,</l>
<l n="2451"> That he would die quickly</l>
<l n="2452"> And who began then to cry</l>
<l n="2453"> Tenderly and to adore God,</l>
<l n="2454"> And God quickly, without hesitating,</l>
<l n="2455"> Extended the King Ezekiel's life</l>
<l n="2456"> By fifteen years.</l>
<l n="2457"> For this reason, I tell you, since I know this,</l>
<l n="2458"> That hope and prayer are not</l>
<l n="2459"> Placed in God in vain.</l>
<l n="2460"> For whoever wishes to do this in the correct way,</l>
<l n="2461"> They [the prayers] cannot lose effectiveness</l>
<l n="2462"> To obtain the full grace of God.</l>
<l n="2463"> And know truly</l>
<l n="2464"> That a man who lives wisely</l>
<l n="2465"> Does not fall into as many perils</l>
<l n="2466"> As people with a foolish spirit.</l>
<l n="2467"> Nevertheless, no one can be so wise,</l>
<l n="2468"> Whether he is a philosopher or a master,</l>
<l n="2469"> That he can avoid all accidents</l>
<l n="2470"> Which I have made occur through my wheels,</l>
<l n="2471"> For often many good and wise men</l>
<l n="2472"> Are subjected to misfortune and suffering</l>
<l n="2473"> Without fault or merit.</l>
<l n="2474"> The proof is sufficiently clear,</l>
<l n="2475"> And, if I must demonstrate it further,</l>
<l n="2476"> I well recall Boethius,</l>
<l n="2477"> Who was a man of good life</l>
<l n="2478"> And a master of philosophy.</l>
<l n="2479"> He was so loyal, wise and honest</l>
<l n="2480"> And the emperors of Rome</l>
<l n="2481"> Believed him to be wise among the wise</l>
<l n="2482"> And loved him and honored him.</l>
<l n="2483"> But through the treacherous Envy</l>
<l n="2484"> Who multiplies every day,</l>
<l n="2485"> Boethius was betrayed unfairly,</l>
<l n="2486"> So that he fell from his position,</l>
<l n="2487"> And my wheel brought him down</l>
<l n="2488"> So that he was very disconsolate.</l>
<l n="2489"> But the beautiful Philosophy</l>
<l n="2490"> Whom he loved, and whom he never abandoned,</l>
<l n="2491"> Comforted him sweetly</l>
<l n="2492"> And showed him very clearly</l>
<l n="2493"> What I am and what I know how to do,</l>
<l n="2494"> And why I am both sweet and bitter.</l>
<l n="2495"> And she told him that, on account of my anger,</l>
<l n="2496"> No wise man should be astonished.</l>
<l n="2497"> Then Boethius, in his poverty,</l>
<l n="2498"> Knew whether I was yellow or green,</l>
<l n="2499"> For, when he had great honors,</l>
<l n="2500"> He did not concern himself with news of me,</l>
<l n="2501"> But when misfortune came close to him,</l>
<l n="2502"> Then he knew me and afterwards was</l>
<l n="2503"> Strong in his tribulations.</l>
<l n="2504"> And Boethius, with his consolation,</l>
<l n="2505"> Made a book which consoles those</l>
<l n="2506"> Whom my wheel has brought into sadness.</l>
<l n="2507"> Thus through the example of Boethius,</l>
<l n="2508"> I have shown you well enough</l>
<l n="2509"> That many wise men who are good</l>
<l n="2510"> Also often find themselves in misery</l>
<l n="2511"> And misfortune—this is obvious—</l>
<l n="2512"> Without fault or merit.</l>
<l n="2513"> And nevertheless there is a reason to this,</l>
<l n="2514"> For God, when he created the world,</l>
<l n="2515"> Wanted there to be a furnace</l>
<l n="2516"> Full of painful embers</l>
<l n="2517"> Through which he would be able to test</l>
<l n="2518"> Those whom he thought to be his friends,</l>
<l n="2519"> So that upon those whom he seeks and loves,</l>
<l n="2520"> He often sows pains and misfortune.</l>
<l n="2521"> And when they have been examined,</l>
<l n="2522"> And refined through patience,</l>
<l n="2523"> He gives them, through true love,</l>
<l n="2524"> The joy that never ceases,</l>
<l n="2525"> For suffering is the true path</l>
<l n="2526"> Towards vanquishing and coming to joy.</l>
<l n="2527"> And the wicked look for comfort</l>
<l n="2528"> As long as they are in this furnace,</l>
<l n="2529"> And they are not interested in patience.</l>
<l n="2530"> And God, who wants to pay them in kind,</l>
<l n="2531"> And since they desire wealth,</l>
<l n="2532"> Leaves them worldly riches.</l>
<l n="2533"> And perhaps through this gift</l>
<l n="2534"> God wishes to give them a reward</l>
<l n="2535"> With some good they could do,</l>
<l n="2536"> For no one is so evil</l>
<l n="2537"> That he does not sometimes endeavor</l>
<l n="2538"> To accomplish a good work,</l>
<l n="2539"> And no one is so full of good qualities</l>
<l n="2540"> That he does not fall into sin often.</l>
<l n="2541"> And God does not want any good to perish,</l>
<l n="2542"> And he wants to pay back any evil,</l>
<l n="2543"> So that to both the good and the bad he pays</l>
<l n="2544"> The appropriate coins.</l>
<l n="2545"> And, as I've sad, I direct</l>
<l n="2546"> The highest sphere of the sky,</l>
<l n="2547"> So that, through me, are ordered</l>
<l n="2548"> All the things born in the world,</l>
<l n="2549"> For stars, the sun and the moon,</l>
<l n="2550"> The sky, and each planet,</l>
<l n="2551"> Have through me—this is the true gloss—</l>
<l n="2552"> Great strength through their influence</l>
<l n="2553"> On all things on earth, below,</l>
<l n="2554"> Such that some are sad</l>
<l n="2555"> And others rich and beautiful,</l>
<l n="2556"> According to the turning of my wheels,</l>
<l n="2557"> And the influence of the planets,</l>
<l n="2558"> Among which some are sweet</l>
<l n="2559"> And others bitter and cruel,</l>
<l n="2560"> According to their different natures</l>
<l n="2561"> Which diversely influence them</l>
<l n="2562"> Towards kind or unkind consideration</l>
<l n="2563"> Towards the terrestrial bodies.</l>
<l n="2564"> It binds them with such relationships</l>
<l n="2565"> That some will never receive anything good</l>
<l n="2566"> While others do not know from where</l>
<l n="2567"> Emanate the goods that fall on them like rain.</l>
<l n="2568"> Some lose, while others find,</l>
<l n="2569"> According to the strength of the planets,</l>
<l n="2570"> And whether they are in a straight or oblique position.</l>
<l n="2571"> For when one is at a good angle</l>
<l n="2572"> Towards the wicked, may God help them,</l>
<l n="2573"> Honor and Grace come to them,</l>
<l n="2574"> Which maintains them in their false state</l>
<l n="2575"> And very often, like someone who </l>
<l n="2576"> Such relationships strike in the money purse [?].</l>
<l n="2577"> Sometimes to the wicked and sometimes to the wise,</l>
<l n="2578"> They distribute humiliations and advantages.</l>
<l n="2579"> The good rise, the bad fall,</l>
<l n="2580"> And they rise in the same way that they fall.</l>
<l n="2581"> And through this beautiful confusion,</l>
<l n="2582"> The rust of the world</l>
<l n="2583"> Is filed off and evil expelled.</l>
<l n="2584"> Because of this, my father is feared</l>
<l n="2585"> For there is nothing in his house</l>
<l n="2586"> That is not made according to reason.</l>
<l n="2587"> And he made me the lady of the world</l>
<l n="2588"> Where there is much inequality,</l>
<l n="2589"> For some have too many comforts,</l>
<l n="2590"> And others too many discomforts;</l>
<l n="2591"> Some are foolish and others wise.</l>
<l n="2592"> And each is very different</l>
<l n="2593"> According to how he falls.</l>
<l n="2594"> For when Nature sculpts bodies,</l>
<l n="2595"> I, Fortune, grant to some</l>
<l n="2596"> Grain and to others straw,</l>
<l n="2597"> In order to pay everyone according to his merits,</l>
<l n="2598"> According to the reasons discussed above.</l>
<l n="2599"> And for this reason, some want to claim,</l>
<l n="2600"> In order to describe me more clearly,</l>
<l n="2601"> That I carry two crowns in my hand,</l>
<l n="2602"> Through which I distribute joy and discomfort</l>
<l n="2603"> To each person, according to my pleasure.</l>
<l n="2604"> But this is a figure and a mystery,</l>
<l n="2605"> For this is only an analogy</l>
<l n="2606"> To better instruct those of rough intellect</l>
<l n="2607"> Who would not be able to understand me</l>
<l n="2608"> Without a very gross exemplum.</l>
<l n="2609"> The same is true of the two wheels</l>
<l n="2610"> That I am said to turn. Listen</l>
<l n="2611"> To the explanation and the meaning</l>
<l n="2612"> That are conveyed in this:</l>
<l n="2613"> The two crowns mentioned above</l>
<l n="2614"> Which are recorded here as an analogy,</l>
<l n="2615"> Of which one seems to be very beautiful</l>
<l n="2616"> And the other ugly and unsellable,</l>
<l n="2617"> Signify the state of the world,</l>
<l n="2618"> Which no wise men trust.</l>
<l n="2619"> This crown that seems to be beautiful,</l>
<l n="2620"> Not everyone who wants it possesses it.</l>
<l n="2621"> There are many beautiful stones on it</l>
<l n="2622"> But some that seem good are not.</l>
<l n="2623"> With such a crown is adorned</l>
<l n="2624"> He who has been raised high through my wheel.</l>
<l n="2625"> I grant it and lend it again,</l>
<l n="2626"> And I am very quick to take it back.</l>
<l n="2627"> This crown signifies</l>
<l n="2628"> Great station in worldly life,</l>
<l n="2629"> Which is weak and crippled in itself,</l>
<l n="2630"> Such that it cannot last long.</l>
<l n="2631"> These beautiful stones signify</l>
<l n="2632"> The riches in which</l>
<l n="2633"> Those who have them put their confidence, who keep them</l>
<l n="2634"> In such a way that they always burn with desire to increase them.</l>
<l n="2635"> Many have placed their pleasure there,</l>
<l n="2636"> And their joy and their substance</l>
<l n="2637"> But these are not precious stones.</l>
<l n="2638"> Rather they are glass,</l>
<l n="2639"> For they are quickly broken</l>
<l n="2640"> And shattered and melted.</l>
<l n="2641"> It is this way with riches,</l>
<l n="2642"> And worldly successes,</l>
<l n="2643"> For they seem to be very beautiful,</l>
<l n="2644"> But in their nature they are such</l>
<l n="2645"> That they are quickly spent,</l>
<l n="2646"> Ruined or lost.</l>
<l n="2647"> And when one has sufficiently suffered</l>
<l n="2648"> And served and applied oneself</l>
<l n="2649"> So that one is rich with the goods of the world,</l>
<l n="2650"> Then comes death, which sinks its teeth in,</l>
<l n="2651"> Everywhere, both into the great and the small,</l>
<l n="2652"> And renders them horrible and naked.</l>
<l n="2653"> Worldly goods are beautiful</l>
<l n="2654"> But they are full of anxiety,</l>
<l n="2655"> And divine scripture</l>
<l n="2656"> Calls riches thorns,</l>
<l n="2657"> For inside, in their hearts and heads,</l>
<l n="2658"> The rich have many misfortunes.</l>
<l n="2659"> But the poor do not believe this,</l>
<l n="2660"> If they have never experienced wealth!</l>
<l n="2661"> Wealth is acquired through work</l>
<l n="2662"> And then held in great fear</l>
<l n="2663"> And abandoned with great sadness.</l>
<l n="2664"> The heart is in great distress,</l>
<l n="2665"> And it becomes very sad and mournful</l>
<l n="2666"> When death comes to separate it</l>
<l n="2667"> From the worldly goods to which it was attached.</l>
<l n="2668"> And the mind becomes sad!</l>
<l n="2669"> Such needles and thorns</l>
<l n="2670"> Are signified by the stones</l>
<l n="2671"> Which are hidden in the crown,</l>
<l n="2672"> Which seems to be beautiful and good.</l>
<l n="2673"> But it is difficult—I hold this to be true—</l>
<l n="2674"> To see them very clearly</l>
<l n="2675"> Because they are so small,</l>
<l n="2676"> And enclosed and sewn on the interior.</l>
<l n="2677"> The other crown, which appears to be evil,</l>
<l n="2678"> Is dirty and vile and ugly and filthy.</l>
<l n="2679"> It signifies great poverty,</l>
<l n="2680"> Which many in this mortal life have,</l>
<l n="2681"> For the poor are ostracized</l>
<l n="2682"> Held as base and little respected.</l>
<l n="2683"> There is no one—this is true—</l>
<l n="2684"> Who, if poverty attacks him,</l>
<l n="2685"> —Even if he is of a good lineage</l>
<l n="2686"> And was a good and wise man—</l>
<l n="2687"> As soon as poverty destroys him,</l>
<l n="2688"> Does not find that everyone flees him and despises him.</l>
<l n="2689"> The poor have such a bitter life</l>
<l n="2690"> That they come close to the verge of despair.</l>
<l n="2691"> And they would truly despair, were it not for my father,</l>
<l n="2692"> Who comforts them in their misery,</l>
<l n="2693"> Through the hope that he sends them</l>
<l n="2694"> That after pain they will have great joy.</l>
<l n="2695"> For, if they live with patience,</l>
<l n="2696"> He will judge them favorably</l>
<l n="2697"> When they arrive at the Last Judgment,</l>
<l n="2698"> And they will have eternal life,</l>
<l n="2699"> According to Holy Scripture,</l>
<l n="2700"> Which teaches this to those who suffer.</l>
<l n="2701"> And in this way they always have hope</l>
<l n="2702"> Of obtaining a better sort. </l>
<l n="2703"> Because I, Fortune, make the rich suffer</l>
<l n="2704"> And lift up the poor,</l>
<l n="2705"> And because there are many of them,</l>
<l n="2706"> They often take comfort</l>
<l n="2707"> In little things, when they are given them.</l>
<l n="2708"> It seems to them to be a great and good thing,</l>
<l n="2709"> And they need less than the rich,</l>
<l n="2710"> And they do not worry about comings and goings.</l>
<l n="2711"> They do not fear loss,</l>
<l n="2712"> Or paying an unjust tax.</l>
<l n="2713"> Such people who are poor and naked</l>
<l n="2714"> With such small comforts</l>
<l n="2715"> Forget their poverty.</l>
<l n="2716"> And these comforts are symbolized by</l>
<l n="2717"> The green emeralds</l>
<l n="2718"> That are hidden in the crown,</l>
<l n="2719"> So that one would barely see them</l>
<l n="2720"> If poverty did not submerge him.</l>
<l n="2721"> You must also understand the two wheels,</l>
<l n="2722"> Of which each one has a smaller one,</l>
<l n="2723"> And they have contrary movements,</l>
<l n="2724"> According to different intentions.</l>
<l n="2725"> The one that turns quickly</l>
<l n="2726"> Signifies truly</l>
<l n="2727"> Some people in the world</l>
<l n="2728"> For whom prosperity came</l>
<l n="2729"> Very quickly and very suddenly,</l>
<l n="2730"> And who have such an abundance of good things,</l>
<l n="2731"> That everyone considers it a miracle.</l>
<l n="2732"> That is when envy comes, which wakes up,</l>
<l n="2733"> And asks how it can be</l>
<l n="2734"> That someone becomes a great master so quickly.</l>
<l n="2735"> Or it is also possible that truth,</l>
<l n="2736"> Which mourns when iniquity</l>
<l n="2737"> Is exalted and put forward</l>
<l n="2738"> And makes people speak of this, rightfully,</l>
<l n="2739"> And complain that someone is elevated</l>
<l n="2740"> Who has no good qualities in him</l>
<l n="2741"> And who does not want or deserve</l>
<l n="2742"> That good people speak highly of him,</l>
<l n="2743"> In this way, he who has risen high,</l>
<l n="2744"> Whether he is full of evil or of good qualities,</l>
<l n="2745"> Is assailed by many things,</l>
<l n="2746"> Through truth or through envy,</l>
<l n="2747"> Or through great sadness or worry,</l>
<l n="2748"> Through sickness or through bad luck;</l>
<l n="2749"> And this is what the small wheel means,</l>
<l n="2750"> Which always fights against the larger one.</l>
<l n="2751"> For there is no one—know this without a doubt—</l>
<l n="2752"> To whom Fortune gives herself completely.</l>
<l n="2753"> And if she were to give herself completely,</l>
<l n="2754"> She is so fickle</l>
<l n="2755"> That she would just as soon want to leave,</l>
<l n="2756"> And no one would be able to restrain her.</l>
<l n="2757"> No man has ever been seen on earth</l>
<l n="2758"> Who was so fortunate</l>
<l n="2759"> That with his felicity</l>
<l n="2760"> He did not also experience adversity,</l>
<l n="2761"> As, for example, someone who has deniers</l>
<l n="2762"> In coffers and attics,</l>
<l n="2763"> But who also has very few friends,</l>
<l n="2764"> Who is a peasant, a bastard, or has devoted</l>
<l n="2765"> His heart and his body to covetousness,</l>
<l n="2766"> Such that everyone hates him and despises him;</l>
<l n="2767"> And he puts such attention into acquiring things</l>
<l n="2768"> That he does not endure eating his fill,</l>
<l n="2769"> Or he acquires in such a way</l>
<l n="2770"> That it is at the cost of great damnation.</l>
<l n="2771"> There is another who is noble,</l>
<l n="2772"> Courtly, generous and attentive</l>
<l n="2773"> To honoring good people,</l>
<l n="2774"> But who is so poor at home</l>
<l n="2775"> That there is nothing so cold as his hearth.</l>
<l n="2776"> On one side, I am a wicked stepmother to him</l>
<l n="2777"> And on the other I am his mother;</l>
<l n="2778"> His situation is mixed in this way.</l>
<l n="2779"> He is honored for his nobility</l>
<l n="2780"> But poverty wounds him in his heart.</l>
<l n="2781"> He would rather be a monk in a cloister,</l>
<l n="2782"> Where no one would be able to recognize him!</l>
<l n="2783"> There is another, a beautiful man, with a good income</l>
<l n="2784"> And a wife who does his desire,</l>
<l n="2785"> But he cannot have children,</l>
<l n="2786"> And who does not know who will be the heir of his wealth.</l>
<l n="2787"> There are also some, by my soul,</l>
<l n="2788"> Who have beautiful children and a beautiful wife,</l>
<l n="2789"> But often one hears news of them</l>
<l n="2790"> That is sad and cruel.</l>
<l n="2791"> There is no prince, king or emperor</l>
<l n="2792"> However high his throne,</l>
<l n="2793"> However noble and however great his power,</l>
<l n="2794"> To whom everything happens according to his desires,</l>
<l n="2795"> For the little counter-wheel</l>
<l n="2796"> Submerges quickly he who swims.</l>
<l n="2797"> And this same conclusion</l>
<l n="2798"> Can be found in the big, slow wheel</l>
<l n="2799"> Which signifies he who rises</l>
<l n="2800"> Or descends, in pain and with shame.</l>
<l n="2801"> May this one be careful, I advise him,</l>
<l n="2802"> Of the other smaller counter-wheel,</l>
<l n="2803"> Which does not stop fighting </l>
<l n="2804"> To un-nail or un-moor</l>
<l n="2805"> Anyone from the wheel above.</l>
<l n="2806"> This is the game of the chantepleure.</l>
<l n="2807"> Through these examples, you can have</l>
<l n="2808"> The understanding necessary to know me.</l>
<l n="2809"> You have not wasted your efforts</l>
<l n="2810"> If you understand well what is Fortune!</l>
<l n="2811"> If you knew well what is good,</l>
<l n="2812"> You would have little love for the world</l>
<l n="2813"> And would not seek your good luck there,</l>
<l n="2814"> For nothing there is certain.</l>
<l n="2815"> What certainty do rich men</l>
<l n="2816"> Who have great heaps of wealth have?</l>
<l n="2817"> Very quickly their goods are taken away.</l>
<l n="2818"> Death settles in next to them</l>
<l n="2819"> So that they know with certainty</l>
<l n="2820"> That they will not live for a long time.</l>
<l n="2821"> For as soon as a child is born of a mother,</l>
<l n="2822"> He does nothing but die and advance</l>
<l n="2823"> Towards his death, hour by hour,</l>
<l n="2824"> And as soon as he is born, he cries,</l>
<l n="2825"> And it appears that Nature tells him</l>
<l n="2826"> That he is born into a hard and mortal life</l>
<l n="2827"> In which he hastens his steps.</l>
<l n="2828"> He will only make a brief stop</l>
<l n="2829"> In great torment and in great pain,</l>
<l n="2830"> Of which the end is never certain.</l>
<l n="2831"> In this way, they have an insane desire,</l>
<l n="2832"> Those whose sovereign pleasure</l>
<l n="2833"> Is in acquiring worldly riches.</l>
<l n="2834"> And they think they have many goods,</l>
<l n="2835"> That they are fortunate and lucky,</l>
<l n="2836"> When they are abundant,</l>
<l n="2837"> But I tell you truly</l>
<l n="2838"> That it is no felicity</l>
<l n="2839"> To have worldly wealth,</l>
<l n="2840"> For you must understand and know</l>
<l n="2841"> That felicity is full</l>
<l n="2842"> Of good, for it is the supreme goodness,</l>
<l n="2843"> Which makes every man a perfect lord</l>
<l n="2844"> If he exerts his effort in choosing this goodness.</l>
<l n="2845"> However, richness does not complete</l>
<l n="2846"> Rich people in this mortal life,</l>
<l n="2847"> For richness is easily lacking,</l>
<l n="2848"> And rich people have many flaws—</l>
<l n="2849"> For example, in health or in joy—</l>
<l n="2850"> Which money cannot give them.</l>
<l n="2851"> And rich people in several countries</l>
<l n="2852"> Are despised on account of their riches,</l>
<l n="2853"> For those who distribute them</l>
<l n="2854"> Are better loved than those who hide them.</l>
<l n="2855"> And Reason considers truly </l>
<l n="2856"> That he lives in servitude,</l>
<l n="2857"> As a serf and with bad luck,</l>
<l n="2858"> Whoever, with the goods he has accumulated,</l>
<l n="2859"> Does not dare to give, touch or take from them,</l>
<l n="2860"> Or spend anything on his own expenses.</l>
<l n="2861"> In wealth there is little luck,</l>
<l n="2862"> Except for he who is so mature</l>
<l n="2863"> And full of good will</l>
<l n="2864"> That he distributes a great abundance to the poor,</l>
<l n="2865"> And through pure and true mercy,</l>
<l n="2866"> Accomplishes works of charity,</l>
<l n="2867"> And the remainder, as a wise man,</l>
<l n="2868"> Spends on himself, for good purposes.</l>
<l n="2869"> For otherwise no wealth</l>
<l n="2870"> Is anything except for grief and great sadness.</l>
<l n="2871"> And you, Fauvel, do not desire anything more</l>
<l n="2872"> Than to be a great lord in the world,</l>
<l n="2873"> But know well that adversity</l>
<l n="2874"> Is worth more than great prosperity,</l>
<l n="2875"> For prosperity inebriates</l>
<l n="2876"> And makes one live in transgression</l>
<l n="2877"> And flatters and praises sweetly,</l>
<l n="2878"> Until Lady Fate arrives,</l>
<l n="2879"> And turns him around in a dishonorable way.</l>
<l n="2880"> He had prepared himself for nothing!</l>
<l n="2881"> His enemies and his friends</l>
<l n="2882"> He did not know, but when Fortune</l>
<l n="2883"> Put him down and threw him to the ground,</l>
<l n="2884"> So that he was in great poverty,</l>
<l n="2885"> Then he discovered those who loved him</l>
<l n="2886"> And those who hated him.</l>
<l n="2887"> For when he had many riches,</l>
<l n="2888"> He was not able to know this.</l>
<l n="2889"> And thus it is truth, and not fable,</l>
<l n="2890"> That adversity is profitable,</l>
<l n="2891"> For the rich live in fear</l>
<l n="2892"> And the poor in great hope,</l>
<l n="2893"> And always believe that Fortune</l>
<l n="2894"> Will grant them some favor through her turning.</l>
<l n="2895"> For this reason, in this hazardous world,</l>
<l n="2896"> No one is truly fortunate</l>
<l n="2897"> Except for he who can suffer</l>
<l n="2898"> The goods that our Lord</l>
<l n="2899"> Gives him in this mortal life,</l>
<l n="2900"> And praises and thanks God,</l>
<l n="2901"> And does not ask for more; rather, he is content</l>
<l n="2902"> And God loves him, for when one attempts</l>
<l n="2903"> From day to day to acquire more,</l>
<l n="2904"> One lives in pain and in war</l>
<l n="2905"> And with a bad conscience.</l>
<l n="2906"> For it is ill-spent energy</l>
<l n="2907"> To love the bitter world,</l>
<l n="2908"> And to abandon love of God;</l>
<l n="2909"> And nobody can truly, it seems to me,</l>
<l n="2910"> Love both God and the world,</l>
<l n="2911"> For they are contrary conditions.</l>
<l n="2912"> Nevertheless, the man</l>
<l n="2913"> Who has a great abundance of great riches,</l>
<l n="2914"> But has not grafted his heart there,</l>
<l n="2915"> Instead spending and giving them away,</l>
<l n="2916"> According to the will of God, with good generosity,</l>
<l n="2917"> Such a rich man, poor in spirit,</l>
<l n="2918"> The gospel calls blessed.”</l>
<l n="2919"> A clerk of the king, François de Rues [Gervais du Bus?],</l>
<l n="2920"> With the words that he has conceived,</l>
<l n="2921"> In this book that he composed,</l>
<l n="2922"> Has well and clearly demonstrated</l>
<l n="2923"> His lively wit, his alacrity,</l>
<l n="2924"> For he speaks very appropriately</l>
<l n="2925"> In this little book. Do not ask me</l>
<l n="2926"> For my permission! May God save him! Amen.  </l>
<l n="2927"> “Fauvel, I have preached to you enough.</l>
<l n="2928"> What does it matter to me if it displeased you?</l>
<l n="2929"> Through what I have said, you have the advantage</l>
<l n="2930"> Of knowing whether you are foolish or wise</l>
<l n="2931"> And of knowing what kind of merchandise</l>
<l n="2932"> Fortune sells, she whom you desire.</l>
<l n="2933"> Now you can see that she is a great lady,</l>
<l n="2934"> Fortune, whom you want to take as a wife.”</l>
<l n="2935"> Then Fauvel delivered</l>
<l n="2936"> This ballade, with a very sick heart.</l>
<l n="2937"> In renewing his complaint,</l>
<l n="2938"> Fauvel sings, with his head lowered.</l>
<l n="2939"> Then Fauvel got up the courage</l>
<l n="2940"> To respond in this way,</l>
<l n="2941"> In a simple and calm manner,</l>
<l n="2942"> To Fortune, who torments him greatly:</l>
<l n="2943"> “My lady, please forgive me</l>
<l n="2944"> If I do not pronounce a word or half of a word</l>
<l n="2945"> Which should, by reason, please you,</l>
<l n="2946"> For today I do not know what to do</l>
<l n="2947"> If you do not take pity upon me.</l>
<l n="2948"> I will start with this line:</l>
<l n="2949"> However much I am wise or foolish,</l>
<l n="2950"> Full of loyalty or vice,</l>
<l n="2951"> Arrogant in actions or words,</l>
<l n="2952"> Presumptuous, insane or audacious</l>
<l n="2953"> To have so boldly undertaken</l>
<l n="2954"> To desire, so highly,</l>
<l n="2955"> To marry the greatest woman</l>
<l n="2956"> Of the world, she who can illuminate everything,</l>
<l n="2957"> You must consider me forgiven,</l>
<l n="2958"> For I have followed the instructions of Love,</l>
<l n="2959"> Who governs, according to his will,</l>
<l n="2960"> All those who are under his command,</l>
<l n="2961"> And who inspires me strongly in the heart</l>
<l n="2962"> To apply myself to composing this poem.</l>
<l n="2963"> I present it to you, in an imperial fashion,</l>
<l n="2964"> Lady of a perfect, courtly heart.</l>
<l n="2965"> Love, whose power is such that</l>
<l n="2966"> The most wise man is unwillingly under his command,</l>
<l n="2967"> And must often obey him,</l>
<l n="2968"> As soon as it happens that </l>
<l n="2969"> Love leads him to desire to serve him.</l>
<l n="2970"> He throws and knows how to direct so brilliantly</l>
<l n="2971"> His arrows, extracted from trickery.</l>
<l n="2972"> He has shot one of his arrows at me</l>
<l n="2973"> According to his pleasure; it seems that he desires</l>
<l n="2974"> That my heart awaken to serve him,</l>
<l n="2975"> After a very long period of rest.</l>
<l n="2976"> Oh! God! If it had pleased</l>
<l n="2977"> Love to spare me</l>
<l n="2978"> From having to bare this burden,</l>
<l n="2979"> He would have done me a great favor,</l>
<l n="2980"> For I have suffered many blows</l>
<l n="2981"> In the time I have served him</l>
<l n="2982"> In order to deserve, through my efforts,</l>
<l n="2983"> The gift that the true lover must await.</l>
<l n="2984"> For this reason, I greatly fear the decision</l>
<l n="2985"> To throw myself into his torments.</l>
<l n="2986"> Nevertheless, however much I was tormented</l>
<l n="2987"> Once in his service,</l>
<l n="2988"> There will never be deceit in my heart,</l>
<l n="2989"> Which would merit reproach from Love,</l>
<l n="2990"> For when I consider the honor, the value,</l>
<l n="2991"> The great good, the profit, the favors</l>
<l n="2992"> That Love allows, as long as one</l>
<l n="2993"> Serves him without remorse,</l>
<l n="2994"> My heart cannot permit</l>
<l n="2995"> That I not do his bidding.</l>
<l n="2996"> This is why, tempted by true love,</l>
<l n="2997"> I will begin to sing with amorous desire.</l>
<l n="2998"> I will truly love, certainly,</l>
<l n="2999"> But already presently I love</l>
<l n="3000"> Since Love desires and commands this.</l>
<l n="3001"> He is insane who would ask for a reason</l>
<l n="3002"> Other than the desire of Love.</l>
<l n="3003"> I must not, truly, refuse.</l>
<l n="3004"> I would commit a great folly</l>
<l n="3005"> If I escaped pleasant desire,</l>
<l n="3006"> Since Love has cultivated it in my heart</l>
<l n="3007"> And, moreover, in order to better know the direction</l>
<l n="3008"> Towards the amorous path,</l>
<l n="3009"> And so that my heart will more easily consent,</l>
<l n="3010"> I have such a sweet model of love</l>
<l n="3011"> That nothing should please me as much</l>
<l n="3012"> (For truly I rightly contemplate myself in it,</l>
<l n="3013"> If I am not the worst of the bad)</l>
<l n="3014"> As leading the life of a lover,</l>
<l n="3015"> And applying my whole being to serving,</l>
<l n="3016"> Especially since I know and see</l>
<l n="3017"> That in this love where Love sends me,</l>
<l n="3018"> And where she desires that I serve with my heart,</l>
<l n="3019"> I do not think that with an obedient heart</l>
<l n="3020"> I will be reproached for anything</l>
<l n="3021"> By any man, as long as he has</l>
<l n="3022"> Well considered and seen my lady</l>
<l n="3023"> And come to know her great worth—</l>
<l n="3024"> Or it is through pure envy</l>
<l n="3025"> That he blames me, for, Saint Mary</l>
<l n="3026"> Why would I be reproached?</l>
<l n="3027"> It is right that I apply myself</l>
<l n="3028"> To being happy and in good humor,</l>
<l n="3029"> If I am not completely insane,</l>
<l n="3030"> Since I am directed to love</l>
<l n="3031"> A lady of worth—this is clear.</l>
<l n="3032"> Of worth? Who fears that in her are lacking</l>
<l n="3033"> Worth, honor, value and goodness?</l>
<l n="3034"> I believe that she has surpassed</l>
<l n="3035"> In wisdom, sweetness and nobility,</l>
<l n="3036"> In noble behavior and elegance,</l>
<l n="3037"> The greater part of those women,</l>
<l n="3038"> Be they ladies or maidens,</l>
<l n="3039"> In the city where she lives.</l>
<l n="3040"> For, truly, may God keep me,</l>
<l n="3041"> Her renown is such that</l>
<l n="3042"> If I had heard her name spoken,</l>
<l n="3043"> I do not know who</l>
<l n="3044"> Would be in disagreement with me,</l>
<l n="3045"> For even those who harbor ill will,</l>
<l n="3046"> And who are not accustomed to saying anything good,</l>
<l n="3047"> Who are commonly called slanderers,</l>
<l n="3048"> Cannot hide their hearts that much</l>
<l n="3049"> (For they hear and see good things about her everywhere)</l>
<l n="3050"> That they do not esteem her.</l>
<l n="3051"> It seems that I am right</l>
<l n="3052"> To be gay and cheerful,</l>
<l n="3053"> Since Love inscribes, night and day,</l>
<l n="3054"> A song in my heart,</l>
<l n="3055"> Which reminds me of the good qualities of my lady.</l>
<l n="3056"> Yes! I am right, by my soul,</l>
<l n="3057"> And because of this I am so happy, I swear, that</l>
<l n="3058"> My heart must rejoice and laugh</l>
<l n="3059"> In joy; I can affirm this,</l>
<l n="3060"> When I gaze at my sweet lady.</l>
<l n="3061"> I must affirm, may God save me,</l>
<l n="3062"> That in worth and honor she surpasses</l>
<l n="3063"> Many women about whom much is often said.</l>
<l n="3064"> God, who creates whatever he wants as is fitting,</l>
<l n="3065"> With beauty, know this, did not</l>
<l n="3066"> Give her less in comparison</l>
<l n="3067"> To what her worth required.</l>
<l n="3068"> This one can see clearly,</l>
<l n="3069"> Whoever examines carefully,</l>
<l n="3070"> How her sweet face looks,</l>
<l n="3071"> And how it is so graceful, sweet God,</l>
<l n="3072"> That nothing does me so much good</l>
<l n="3073"> As to gaze into her bright face,</l>
<l n="3074"> [Which is] fresh, of a rosy complexion.</l>
<l n="3075"> And afterwards her very sweet little mouth,</l>
<l n="3076"> Red like a cherry,</l>
<l n="3077"> Which is so pleasantly positioned,</l>
<l n="3078"> So tasty and amused,</l>
<l n="3079"> That any lover must, with an eager heart,</l>
<l n="3080"> Have the desire to approach</l>
<l n="3081"> And to touch this tender mouth.</l>
<l n="3082"> And also her joyful eyes,</l>
<l n="3083"> From which a sweet gaze emanates,</l>
<l n="3084"> For which reason I rightly want to look at her</l>
<l n="3085"> And because of which anyone has difficulty preventing himself</l>
<l n="3086"> From being struck, with no defense,</l>
<l n="3087"> If he has his eye open and turned in that direction,</l>
<l n="3088"> Because they are so gay and, in a very pleasant way,</l>
<l n="3089"> Decorated with sweet deception.</l>
<l n="3090"> Oh, God! I protected myself poorly from these eyes,</l>
<l n="3091"> For, ever since they gazed at me,</l>
<l n="3092"> Neither granary nor farm has been of use to me [to hide?],</l>
<l n="3093"> For, truly, as I realize,</l>
<l n="3094"> And as it has always seemed to me...</l>
<l n="3095"> Stolen! Can this truly be true?</l>
<l n="3096"> Yes! For moreover, truly,</l>
<l n="3097"> I wish [?] that my heart would resolve</l>
<l n="3098"> To be happy and strong in love,</l>
<l n="3099"> Since my dear lady</l>
<l n="3100"> Has such a sweet face, and a sweet expression,</l>
<l n="3101"> That nothing is there except as one would wish,</l>
<l n="3102"> Even though I am not describing fully</l>
<l n="3103"> What I see there. A beautiful apparition </l>
<l n="3104"> Love presents to me in the encounter.</l>
<l n="3105"> At the first sight of her sweet face,</l>
<l n="3106"> And the appearance of her noble body,</l>
<l n="3107"> Which is so completely in conformity </l>
<l n="3108"> That there is no man alive in the world,</l>
<l n="3109"> If he knew how to look well,</l>
<l n="3110"> Who would find something to reproach there,</l>
<l n="3111"> So much is her body distinguished and alert.</l>
<l n="3112"> Her beautiful, sweet eyes! And when the memory</l>
<l n="3113"> Is in my heart of the design</l>
<l n="3114"> Of such a sweet creature,</l>
<l n="3115"> Whose face</l>
<l n="3116"> Is like nothing in nature,</l>
<l n="3117"> And with a body so distinguished and elegant</l>
<l n="3118"> —And I see her noble and graceful attire—</l>
<l n="3119"> That he is not transported away by this excess,</l>
<l n="3120"> And I reconsider, next, the port</l>
<l n="3121"> Of her noble body and her manner</l>
<l n="3122"> Which is neither proud nor arrogant,</l>
<l n="3123"> But rather simple, sweet and lovable,</l>
<l n="3124"> And the port remains so appropriate </l>
<l n="3125"> And she knows how to carry herself so well,</l>
<l n="3126"> That there is no soul who sees her</l>
<l n="3127"> When she goes down the road,</l>
<l n="3128"> Who does not love her—because of which I esteem her.</l>
<l n="3129"> Therefore, if Love has stolen or taken</l>
<l n="3130"> My heart, through the gaze</l>
<l n="3131"> Of such a woman, may God help me!</l>
<l n="3132"> It is not fitting that I put on</l>
<l n="3133"> A sad or astonished expression,</l>
<l n="3134"> For why would I be anxious?</l>
<l n="3135"> The fear that my heart has been lost</l>
<l n="3136"> Has completely left me,</l>
<l n="3137"> Even if it stays there forever,</l>
<l n="3138"> Since Love wants me to remember</l>
<l n="3139"> And remains in me a little bit.</l>
<l n="3140"> Rather I say—may God govern me!—</l>
<l n="3141"> That if until today</l>
<l n="3142"> My heart was in great torment,</l>
<l n="3143"> Wounded and pained by troubles,</l>
<l n="3144"> Now it has risen and been lifted up,</l>
<l n="3145"> And if it was ever lost,</l>
<l n="3146"> It has now been found.</l>
<l n="3147"> And it seems to me that I am right,</l>
<l n="3148"> For my heart, in another period,</l>
<l n="3149"> Before the arrow had touched it,</l>
<l n="3150"> This arrow poisoned with fear,</l>
<l n="3151"> Which has now taken root in me,</l>
<l n="3152"> Was weak and miserable and knocked down,</l>
<l n="3153"> Afflicted and mournful and almost dead.</l>
<l n="3154"> But now, when I feel</l>
<l n="3155"> The torments of sweet remembrance</l>
<l n="3156"> Of the graceful appearance</l>
<l n="3157"> Of my lady, from which all good comes to me,</l>
<l n="3158"> Or when it happens through good luck</l>
<l n="3159"> That I am able to see her in front of me,</l>
<l n="3160"> Never again will a day come</l>
<l n="3161"> When I do not feel stronger</l>
<l n="3162"> And willingly apply myself</l>
<l n="3163"> To doing and saying happy things,</l>
<l n="3164"> In taking pleasure and enjoying myself,</l>
<l n="3165"> Since my heart has been taken in this way,</l>
<l n="3166"> By Love, it can only be</l>
<l n="3167"> Joyful and gay;</l>
<l n="3168"> And joy lives in it,</l>
<l n="3169"> And makes me live joyfully,</l>
<l n="3170"> Remaining joyful and gay.</l>
<l n="3171"> Truly, I can well sing this time:</l>
<l n="3172"> He decided to capture me joyfully,</l>
<l n="3173"> Love, as you can hear:</l>
<l n="3174"> Capture? Truly! He captured me well!</l>
<l n="3175"> No man was ever taken so well,</l>
<l n="3176"> This I can truly affirm,</l>
<l n="3177"> For if it happens that a man is, because of debt,</l>
<l n="3178"> Or because of some other misdeed,</l>
<l n="3179"> Put into prison,</l>
<l n="3180"> If his body is imprisoned,</l>
<l n="3181"> Neither the knowledge that God gave him</l>
<l n="3182"> To govern and conduct himself,</l>
<l n="3183"> Nor his heart can be restrained.</l>
<l n="3184"> But I am taken by a powerful master—</l>
<l n="3185"> For I do not see how this is possible—</l>
<l n="3186"> Lords, with none of the faculties that I have,</l>
<l n="3187"> Or with my heart, which me pulls completely</l>
<l n="3188"> Always, without my desire to stop it,</l>
<l n="3189"> Towards the place where the arrow must have left</l>
<l n="3190"> Which Love wanted me to feel.</l>
<l n="3191"> Do not understand by this that my heart might be able,</l>
<l n="3192"> One day, to distance itself,</l>
<l n="3193"> However much I have to suffer</l>
<l n="3194"> In great pain and great torment.</l>
<l n="3195"> This makes me see, if ever I knew anything about all this,</l>
<l n="3196"> That the body can be pulled easily</l>
<l n="3197"> Towards wherever it pleases the heart.</l>
<l n="3198"> Therefore I am caught, without a doubt,</l>
<l n="3199"> For, without leaving anything behind,</l>
<l n="3200"> Love has seized everything according to his pleasure—</l>
<l n="3201"> Heart, members, body, intellect.</l>
<l n="3202"> And certainly, in order to do his bidding,</l>
<l n="3203"> I want to offer him my body and heart</l>
<l n="3204"> For as long as I am liberated</l>
<l n="3205"> By my lady, to whom I have handed myself over.</l>
<l n="3206"> But when I am able to know for certain</l>
<l n="3207"> That no treasure, no wealth,</l>
<l n="3208"> However much I might be able to give,</l>
<l n="3209"> Would not be able to ransom me,</l>
<l n="3210"> Or loosen the bonds in any way—</l>
<l n="3211"> Those where I have been taken as hers—</l>
<l n="3212"> Of she whom I must call my lady,</l>
<l n="3213"> Except for loyally loving</l>
<l n="3214"> And courageously serving,</l>
<l n="3215"> For this reason, in order to merit forgiveness,</l>
<l n="3216"> So that I might one day be delivered.</l>
<l n="3217"> Know that as long as I have to live,</l>
<l n="3218"> Without any reservations at all,</l>
<l n="3219"> If I have recklessly placed</l>
<l n="3220"> In honor and without shame,</l>
<l n="3221"> My heart, body, intellect and understanding</l>
<l n="3222"> —Without reserving anything—</l>
<l n="3223"> Into serving my very sweet lady,</l>
<l n="3224"> It is certainly right that I am imprisoned,</l>
<l n="3225"> For I was born under a fortunate star,</l>
<l n="3226"> When it was written into my destiny</l>
<l n="3227"> That I would devote my attention to serving</l>
<l n="3228"> Such a sweet creature</l>
<l n="3229"> —In whom there might be so much beauty enclosed—</l>
<l n="3230"> As my lady, who is a rose</l>
<l n="3231"> In both intellect and beauty,</l>
<l n="3232"> Because of which I must, it seems to me,</l>
<l n="3233"> Love, serve and honor her.</l>
<l n="3234"> Alas! It can stay this way too long,</l>
<l n="3235"> However much serving I do,</l>
<l n="3236"> Before I obtain assistance or pardon</l>
<l n="3237"> From my lady, from the sickness</l>
<l n="3238"> That I feel, full of amorous fury,</l>
<l n="3239"> And because of which, in her prison, night and day,</l>
<l n="3240"> I languish, sick, with no reprieve.</l>
<l n="3241"> For how would she rescue me,</l>
<l n="3242"> The sweet lady, when she never received</l>
<l n="3243"> Any news through me,</l>
<l n="3244"> For she held me so tight in her chains?</l>
<l n="3245"> For I have not yet been so bold;</l>
<l n="3246"> I am taken prisoner, and fearful that</l>
<l n="3247"> My heart, which appears to be open,</l>
<l n="3248"> Has not been revealed to her.</l>
<l n="3249"> Certainly, this would be too difficult to do!</l>
<l n="3250"> And because I can I might well suffer</l>
<l n="3251"> Before being treated this way,</l>
<l n="3252"> If it is not known by my lady,</l>
<l n="3253"> For who without anything easy</l>
<l n="3254"> Would be able to relieve my suffering?</l>
<l n="3255"> Whatever might happen afterwards,</l>
<l n="3256"> I want her to perceive or notice,</l>
<l n="3257"> If this pleases her, in what way</l>
<l n="3258"> I have undertaken to serve her with my heart.</l>
<l n="3259"> But I do not see how</l>
<l n="3260"> More nobly or more completely</l>
<l n="3261"> I would be able to reveal my heart</l>
<l n="3262"> To the sweet and wise lady</l>
<l n="3263"> If it is not in singing, and because of this,</l>
<l n="3264"> With as loyal a heart as I must have,</l>
<l n="3265"> I sing, letting myself go with my desire:</l>
<l n="3266"> I gave myself to you, without fear,</l>
<l n="3267"> My lady, in such a way that </l>
<l n="3268"> I placed all of my efforts in you,</l>
<l n="3269"> Without ever ceasing</l>
<l n="3270"> In all of the days of my life.</l>
<l n="3271"> Ah! Lady adorned in all virtues,</l>
<l n="3272"> May it please the great nobility</l>
<l n="3273"> Which resides in your body,</l>
<l n="3274"> And the sweetness and the generosity</l>
<l n="3275"> Which are always within you,</l>
<l n="3276"> May they wish to move your heart</l>
<l n="3277"> So that I am not, at any cost,</l>
<l n="3278"> Taken away by you, but may you rather</l>
<l n="3279"> Wish to take me</l>
<l n="3280"> And to consider my service,</l>
<l n="3281"> So that if your sweet heart considers</l>
<l n="3282"> If through my loyal love,</l>
<l n="3283"> I should be called your lover,</l>
<l n="3284"> And if the suffering and pain</l>
<l n="3285"> Which weighs upon my heart</l>
<l n="3286"> —For I have pain now and used to have some—</l>
<l n="3287"> Should be favorably received.</l>
<l n="3288"> And, however much I have served,</l>
<l n="3289"> I must not have failed to deserve that</l>
<l n="3290"> One grant me</l>
<l n="3291"> The mercy for which I must implore you so much.</l>
<l n="3292"> May it please you, my lady, at least</l>
<l n="3293"> To lighten my suffering,</l>
<l n="3294"> That I find a sweet appearance in you,</l>
<l n="3295"> And that I see, without fear, that I might</l>
<l n="3296"> Confirm the hope in my heart</l>
<l n="3297"> To obtain what I wish for:</l>
<l n="3298"> This is to be received as a lover.</l>
<l n="3299"> If my misfortune is such,</l>
<l n="3300"> Lady, as long as God does not consent</l>
<l n="3301"> That sweetness and noble pity</l>
<l n="3302"> Flee so far away from you</l>
<l n="3303"> That I might find opposition</l>
<l n="3304"> In my situation of need [?],</l>
<l n="3305"> Truly, certainly, at that hour</l>
<l n="3306"> Bad fortune was showered upon me</l>
<l n="3307"> When I looked at your sweet face,</l>
<l n="3308"> My lady, if you, in whom I have placed</l>
<l n="3309"> All of my attention and solicitude,</l>
<l n="3310"> Desired to show me a welcome</l>
<l n="3311"> Thanks to which, reasonably,</l>
<l n="3312"> The good hope that must remain in me </l>
<l n="3313"> —And through which I expect relief from you —</l>
<l n="3314"> Would wane, alas, I would just as well hang myself!</l>
<l n="3315"> For what evil could befall me as much as</l>
<l n="3316"> Losing your assistance?</l>
<l n="3317"> Alas, lady, I would be so afflicted</l>
<l n="3318"> If I lost your sweet assistance!</l>
<l n="3319"> For certainly, if it were lost to me,</l>
<l n="3320"> It is my life that would be lacking!</l>
<l n="3321"> But how could it happen</l>
<l n="3322"> That you not retain me,</l>
<l n="3323"> For I am, lady, joined to you</l>
<l n="3324"> As true love joined me to you.</l>
<l n="3325"> And you know the purity [of love?]!</l>
<l n="3326"> Certainly it would be a great trial</l>
<l n="3327"> And it would be very difficult for me to believe,</l>
<l n="3328"> For, my lady, nothing comforts me so much</l>
<l n="3329"> As the fact that when I saw your sweet face,</l>
<l n="3330"> When my heart was ravished by love,</l>
<l n="3331"> It seemed to be above all others</l>
<l n="3332"> Gracious, worthy of pity, and sweet.</l>
<l n="3333"> For it did not seem in any way,</l>
<l n="3334"> As long as your generosity lasted,</l>
<l n="3335"> That you would leave me to bear my great pain</l>
<l n="3336"> Forever, without comforting me,</l>
<l n="3337"> Or without having any distraction</l>
<l n="3338"> From you, for the sake of whose love I bear it,</l>
<l n="3339"> So much do I hope for your forgiveness in love [?].</l>
<l n="3340"> May the eyes in your bright face be cursed—</l>
<l n="3341"> Which began to move so sweetly</l>
<l n="3342"> Towards me when they were forced to look at me.</l>
<l n="3343"> Therefore if your very kind gaze</l>
<l n="3344"> Had to draw me towards you,</l>
<l n="3345"> Through the sweetness that I felt there,</l>
<l n="3346"> When I sought refuge near you for assistance,</l>
<l n="3347"> If sweetness leaves you</l>
<l n="3348"> About your sweet gaze, treason!</l>
<l n="3349"> My lady, if this is the way it is, without a debt,</l>
<l n="3350"> That in you sweetness is lacking towards me,</l>
<l n="3351"> I have a right to pursue a suit against you,</l>
<l n="3352"> My lady; know that my accusation</l>
<l n="3353"> Would be of treachery,</l>
<l n="3354"> For where is there a greater misdeed</l>
<l n="3355"> Than in completely drawing in a man towards oneself</l>
<l n="3356"> By making sweet, attractive glances,</l>
<l n="3357"> And afterwards, when he is caught in the trap,</l>
<l n="3358"> And the miserable, poor man is taken,</l>
<l n="3359"> Leaving him to languish in this state</l>
<l n="3360"> Without giving him any assistance at all?</l>
<l n="3361"> This would be cruelty, certainly!</l>
<l n="3362"> As long as, of a person of great beauty,</l>
<l n="3363"> Such calumny could be spoken,</l>
<l n="3364"> As of you, in cruelty </l>
<l n="3365"> May it never come to pass </l>
<l n="3366"> But certainly it will not.</l>
<l n="3367"> For it is commonly said</l>
<l n="3368"> That mercy must be stationed</l>
<l n="3369"> In a heart of noble feeling.</l>
<l n="3370"> For this reason, it cannot be the case at all,</l>
<l n="3371"> Certainly, that [such a heart] does not remain in you,</l>
<l n="3372"> For according to what resembles</l>
<l n="3373"> Your sweet, loving face,</l>
<l n="3374"> A noble, well-tested heart</l>
<l n="3375"> Must, according to rights, be found in you.</l>
<l n="3376"> And because of the example</l>
<l n="3377"> That I am able to find in your sweet face</l>
<l n="3378"> Which reassures me with its sweetness,</l>
<l n="3379"> My hope is very certain</l>
<l n="3380"> That your generous heart full of friendship</l>
<l n="3381"> Will have pity on me again,</l>
<l n="3382"> Because of this, gracious one,</l>
<l n="3383"> I relinquish as of this moment,</l>
<l n="3384"> For as long as I will live,</l>
<l n="3385"> The right to file a suit against you</l>
<l n="3386"> And to live in another way, at the end,</l>
<l n="3387"> Except that all of my rewards are in you.</l>
<l n="3388"> And as someone who desires ardently</l>
<l n="3389"> To have help in his pain,</l>
<l n="3390"> Whose heart is darkened and blackened </l>
<l n="3391"> Sweet, well made, charming and delicious,</l>
<l n="3392"> Pleasant, beautiful and graceful one,</l>
<l n="3393"> Sovereign in intelligence and beauty,</l>
<l n="3394"> Fountain of honor and valor,</l>
<l n="3395"> In whom sweetness and concord live,</l>
<l n="3396"> As well as pity and graciousness,</l>
<l n="3397"> Of all beauty, the lily and the rose,</l>
<l n="3398"> Lady in whom as much grace is enclosed</l>
<l n="3399"> As there is water in the sea,</l>
<l n="3400"> Generous, loving heart, without bitterness,</l>
<l n="3401"> With joined hands, I would like to pray</l>
<l n="3402"> That you not desire to push away</l>
<l n="3403"> The mercy that must come to me through you.</l>
<l n="3404"> And may God grant that you be reminded</l>
<l n="3405"> And that it please you that I be granted</l>
<l n="3406"> That you have pity on me,</l>
<l n="3407"> Since I am, lady—know this—</l>
<l n="3408"> Anchored and attached</l>
<l n="3409"> With my whole heart in love for you,</l>
<l n="3410"> So that on no road or path</l>
<l n="3411"> At any time is my attention not directed</l>
<l n="3412"> Towards pleasant service for you.</l>
<l n="3413"> I do not want to direct it anywhere else,</l>
<l n="3414"> However much I must suffer.</l>
<l n="3415"> I must sigh and complain,</l>
<l n="3416"> Moderate my heart and darken my complexion,</l>
<l n="3417"> For, my very sweet, dear lady,</l>
<l n="3418"> With all pains and all suffering put behind me,</l>
<l n="3419"> Good hope, through which a lover</l>
<l n="3420"> Relieves himself of his anguish, comforts me,</l>
<l n="3421"> And gives me the will</l>
<l n="3422"> To abandon heart and body completely</l>
<l n="3423"> Without holding anything back</l>
<l n="3424"> In order to endure and sustain,</l>
<l n="3425"> For your sake, the sweet pains of love</l>
<l n="3426"> Which are so sweetly delectable</l>
<l n="3427"> To me, and pleasant to feel,</l>
<l n="3428"> That I do not wish to repent for them ever,</l>
<l n="3429"> Rather I would like to give in to them completely</l>
<l n="3430"> Even if I do not feel certain,</l>
<l n="3431"> Even though hope leads me in this direction,</l>
<l n="3432"> That from my service, lady,</l>
<l n="3433"> I will obtain a sweet reward in the end. </l>
<l n="3434"> Now may it be fitting, my sweet kind lady,</l>
<l n="3435"> Completely, in entirety, with no reservation,</l>
<l n="3436"> Nor exception, nor reserve,</l>
<l n="3437"> In the highness and great worth</l>
<l n="3438"> Of your sweet heart full of generosity,</l>
<l n="3439"> To command, according to your desire,</l>
<l n="3440"> As if for your serf and liegeman,</l>
<l n="3441"> That I, who loyally serve you</l>
<l n="3442"> —if it pleases you—</l>
<l n="3443"> Receive as a gift, through heartfelt feeling, </l>
<l n="3444"> Your sweet, simple and pretty love,</l>
<l n="3445"> Even though I am not worthy</l>
<l n="3446"> To receive such a very valuable gift,</l>
<l n="3447"> In consideration of my worth. But if, truly,</l>
<l n="3448"> If it happens that </l>
<l n="3449"> Your sweetness and your grace act so that</l>
<l n="3450"> Your sweet heart is brought to this,</l>
<l n="3451"> Through mercy for me that would overcome you,</l>
<l n="3452"> Or if it pleases you to leave me</l>
<l n="3453"> In this way, without resigning yourself to</l>
<l n="3454"> Your sweet help assisting me</l>
<l n="3455"> With the pains in which I still languish,</l>
<l n="3456"> My heart captive in your prison,</l>
<l n="3457"> And of which I will never obtain the cure,</l>
<l n="3458"> If pity does not make you agree</l>
<l n="3459"> To have mercy on me,</l>
<l n="3460"> For whatever it might please you to do</l>
<l n="3461"> —To leave me in this suffering</l>
<l n="3462"> To live or to languish as a martyr,</l>
<l n="3463"> Or if it might be enough for you,</l>
<l n="3464"> What I have endured and endure—,</l>
<l n="3465"> May it not go on any longer</l>
<l n="3466"> That you not bring me assistance;</l>
<l n="3467"> And I want you to know well,</l>
<l n="3468"> My lady, that as long as I have to live,</l>
<l n="3469"> Whatever should happen afterwards,</l>
<l n="3470"> In the same way as I have done until now,</l>
<l n="3471"> And as a true lover must do: </l>
<l n="3472"> The man whose heart Love governs,</l>
<l n="3473"> Whom ardent desire wounds and animates,</l>
<l n="3474"> When he sees that luck is against him,</l>
<l n="3475"> On the part of his lady, whom he serves,</l>
<l n="3476"> In whatever manner [?], in whatever way,</l>
<l n="3477"> He comforts himself from his pain [?].</l>
<l n="3478"> If he succeeds, it is a wonder</l>
<l n="3479"> That Love knows how to so poorly equip</l>
<l n="3480"> The man who is entangled in his trap.</l>
<l n="3481"> He makes him sleep little and wake often,</l>
<l n="3482"> Rest little and suffer a lot.</l>
<l n="3483"> It encloses and embraces all of his intelligence.</l>
<l n="3484"> Afterwards, Desire, brought by Love,</l>
<l n="3485"> Agitates his heart so strongly with burning,</l>
<l n="3486"> Through thoughts, that he burns like a wick</l>
<l n="3487"> In desiring the noble honor</l>
<l n="3488"> In the acquisition of which lovers have difficulty.</l>
<l n="3489"> Desire burns the heart, the body dries up.</l>
<l n="3490"> And when man is brought to this point,</l>
<l n="3491"> That at all times his body is pained,</l>
<l n="3492"> His heart completely burning, his intelligence captured,</l>
<l n="3493"> He is badly assailed by luck!</l>
<l n="3494"> If I say that such a person</l>
<l n="3495"> Must be out of his mind, I am not mistaken.</l>
<l n="3496"> It is true that in sweet hope</l>
<l n="3497"> He can find relief from his torments,</l>
<l n="3498"> The lover in whom the heart resides,</l>
<l n="3499"> But when he sees that misfortune</l>
<l n="3500"> Weighs more on his scale,</l>
<l n="3501"> Little hope remains for him.</l>
<l n="3502"> Alas! I who offer you these words,</l>
<l n="3503"> I am engaged in such a battle night and day!</l>
<l n="3504"> Love does not let me rest:</l>
<l n="3505"> He encloses my mind and makes my body suffer.</l>
<l n="3506"> Desire seizes my heart completely</l>
<l n="3507"> With a burning that does not stop in me.</l>
<l n="3508"> Of suffering in the body, without lying,</l>
<l n="3509"> Or feeling burning in the heart,</l>
<l n="3510"> Alas! I would not have dared to complain,</l>
<l n="3511"> If luck had wished to grant me</l>
<l n="3512"> That it would protect me in my pains,</l>
<l n="3513"> And that love should be able to remain strong in me.</l>
<l n="3514"> But when I see myself so unfortunate</l>
<l n="3515"> That I see luck leap away from me,</l>
<l n="3516"> When the burning of love comes to attack</l>
<l n="3517"> My heart so violently,</l>
<l n="3518"> It is right, truly, that in me</l>
<l n="3519"> Good hope completely disappear. </l>
<l n="3520"> Certainly it is obvious that luck flees from me</l>
<l n="3521"> And that bad luck follows me,</l>
<l n="3522"> Since I realize that the pain I have </l>
<l n="3523"> For my lady, whom I hold so dear,</l>
<l n="3524"> Night and day, troubles and bothers her,</l>
<l n="3525"> And, to judge from her expression, I do not have hope of assistance.</l>
<l n="3526"> Is it, therefore, a surprise—</l>
<l n="3527"> If I feel that my body, heart, and intelligence aching</l>
<l n="3528"> With the pains that I feel coming from love,</l>
<l n="3529"> And if I do not see that luck wishes me well</l>
<l n="3530"> With respect to [?] she who surpasses all in the world—</l>
<l n="3531"> If I want to finish in despair?</l>
<l n="3532"> It is better that I consent to my ending</l>
<l n="3533"> Than that I experience martyrdom always, languishing,</l>
<l n="3534"> And without the comfort of hope.</l>
<l n="3535"> Whoever expects death with certainty,</l>
<l n="3536"> It is better for him to have a short death than a long one.</l>
<l n="3537"> Of two evils, the lesser one is better!</l>
<l n="3538"> Alas! But if my heart resigns itself to this,</l>
<l n="3539"> Reason blames me and gives me</l>
<l n="3540"> Advice to abandon this path,</l>
<l n="3541"> For whoever consents to such a base death</l>
<l n="3542"> Or who lets his mind deviate</l>
<l n="3543"> Is worthy of disdain.</l>
<l n="3544"> God, what will I do! Now I am captured!</l>
<l n="3545"> By reason I am dishonorably criticized</l>
<l n="3546"> If despair sets death as a trap for me;</l>
<l n="3547"> But on the other hand I am racked by pain</l>
<l n="3548"> So that I value my life little,</l>
<l n="3549"> And I do not believe I will attain grace. </l>
<l n="3550"> I cannot remain this way, truly!</l>
<l n="3551"> What will I do, then? In lamenting,</l>
<l n="3552"> I would like, if possible, to distract myself from my suffering;</l>
<l n="3553"> I do not mean by this that I would like to restrain them,</l>
<l n="3554"> For I could not attain this without she</l>
<l n="3555"> Who would be able to comfort me completely.</l>
<l n="3556"> Comfort? Alas! I have seen that</l>
<l n="3557"> She has not cared for a long time,</l>
<l n="3558"> And this has tempted me to despair,</l>
<l n="3559"> Since she knew well</l>
<l n="3560"> That I have towards her and have had</l>
<l n="3561"> A perfect heart and will.</l>
<l n="3562"> In any case, whatever occurs,</l>
<l n="3563"> Whether she takes pity on me or remains indifferent,</l>
<l n="3564"> To she whom I love without trickery,</l>
<l n="3565"> I would like to complain, without fault.</l>
<l n="3566"> May God grant me that it be worthy of relieving</l>
<l n="3567"> The painful torments I receive in response.</l>
<l n="3568"> And since it has come to this,</l>
<l n="3569"> That I have come to lamentations,</l>
<l n="3570"> I consent to making my complaints</l>
<l n="3571"> Through this motet, which I have retained,</l>
<l n="3572"> For I am handled in the same way</l>
<l n="3573"> As he about whom this motet harmonizes. </l>
<l n="3574"> Now my life and my death</l>
<l n="3575"> Are in your hands completely, my lady;</l>
<l n="3576"> I want this with my whole heart, without hesitation</l>
<l n="3577"> Of any sort—may no one believe this.</l>
<l n="3578"> May God grant that pity touch you enough</l>
<l n="3579"> That my end not have come.</l>
<l n="3580"> Alas! Very sweet, refined lady,</l>
<l n="3581"> If you ever desired that</l>
<l n="3582"> My life be over in such a short time,</l>
<l n="3583"> [The life] that I have planted in you,</l>
<l n="3584"> My love, alas! What a destiny!</l>
<l n="3585"> My whole heart would tear up with horror.</l>
<l n="3586"> I cannot see any other end</l>
<l n="3587"> To my painful torments than death,</l>
<l n="3588"> My lady; and this must happen to me</l>
<l n="3589"> If you do not deign to consent</l>
<l n="3590"> To relieving my pains</l>
<l n="3591"> Through the sweet assistance that might come to me.</l>
<l n="3592"> Certainly, if I do not have your sweet assistance,</l>
<l n="3593"> My dear lady, the only outcome</l>
<l n="3594"> Is death, and I will be delivered.</l>
<l n="3595"> Therefore may you grant that it be a short while</l>
<l n="3596"> Before I have recourse to your assistance.</l>
<l n="3597"> In this way I will be able, my lady, to live in hope.</l>
<l n="3598"> Ah, nobility seated in a noble body,</l>
<l n="3599"> Sweetness of face, generosity of the heart,</l>
<l n="3600"> May you have pity on your lover,</l>
<l n="3601"> Who has placed his intentions in you.</l>
<l n="3602"> In the world, he does not value anything else,</l>
<l n="3603"> Nor does he ask for anything else.</l>
<l n="3604"> God, it would be too cruel</l>
<l n="3605"> Sweet lady, since you know</l>
<l n="3606"> My pain, and that I have attached my heart</l>
<l n="3607"> To serving you completely,</l>
<l n="3608"> That you suffer that in bad fortune</l>
<l n="3609"> I die, without deserving it.</l>
<l n="3610"> Deserving it? Alas! That in my life</l>
<l n="3611"> I have committed a fault towards you</l>
<l n="3612"> In deeds or in words, this cannot be!</l>
<l n="3613"> Alas! Where would such furor come from?</l>
<l n="3614"> Truly, if I had committed such a fault,</l>
<l n="3615"> I must have been born under a bad star!</l>
<l n="3616"> And how, sweet, gracious one,</l>
<l n="3617"> Would you be so against me,</l>
<l n="3618"> If you do not know me to have erred,</l>
<l n="3619"> That you would desire my death?</l>
<l n="3620"> Alas! Certainly, you do not have the reputation</l>
<l n="3621"> Or the appearance of being so cruel!</l>
<l n="3622"> Therefore, noble body and bright face,</l>
<l n="3623"> May you deign that your generous heart,</l>
<l n="3624"> Which loves you without deception,</l>
<l n="3625"> Grant me grace through sweetness and pity.</l>
<l n="3626"> God! Will I see you in such a place</l>
<l n="3627"> As to deign to receive me willingly?</l>
<l n="3628"> Alas! And I have the right, if I dare to say it,</l>
<l n="3629"> To be worthy of such a lofty thing,</l>
<l n="3630"> Through my person and my merits,</l>
<l n="3631"> If you, lily and rose of beauty,</l>
<l n="3632"> Through the sweetness that resides in you,</l>
<l n="3633"> Do not grant me grace, certainly.</l>
<l n="3634"> Oh, lady who is loved with an ardent heart,</l>
<l n="3635"> Begged for by me night and day,</l>
<l n="3636"> Now may your grace be opened to me</l>
<l n="3637"> For I die of ardor of enflamed love,</l>
<l n="3638"> And no word has been spoken of this</l>
<l n="3639"> Except for what I have revealed to you above.</l>
<l n="3640"> Therefore, lady, make sure</l>
<l n="3641"> That no one knows my torments; this concerns</l>
<l n="3642"> Only you, and one cannot counsel me</l>
<l n="3643"> Since I am now exclusively under your power.</l>
<l n="3644"> By God, may your assistance come quickly!</l>
<l n="3645"> It is time to direct your attention towards this!</l>
<l n="3646"> Dear lady, I have great fear</l>
<l n="3647"> That my relief be compromised</l>
<l n="3648"> By two things; I fear each of them!</l>
<l n="3649"> That to your sweet company</l>
<l n="3650"> Someone other than me</l>
<l n="3651"> Aspires, with your agreement. This is one.</l>
<l n="3652"> The other is this: I fear that when I come</l>
<l n="3653"> Near you in order to beg you, it seems</l>
<l n="3654"> That I do not serve you except with hypocritical words,</l>
<l n="3655"> Since I do not tremble or waver,</l>
<l n="3656"> And when company is assembled,</l>
<l n="3657"> That I sing and play and enjoy myself.</l>
<l n="3658"> Alas! As for the first fear,</l>
<l n="3659"> I pray that death strike me down</l>
<l n="3660"> Before things become as I have imagined!</l>
<l n="3661"> I would much rather be in a coffin</l>
<l n="3662"> Than be put aside for another</l>
<l n="3663"> By she whom I love so much; I would go crazy!</l>
<l n="3664"> As to the other, dear lord God,</l>
<l n="3665"> When I come close to you, my lady, as much</l>
<l n="3666"> As I am able, I am given courage and force.</l>
<l n="3667"> He could well be disposed in such a way </l>
<l n="3668"> </l>
<l n="3669"> For this reason, I exert myself in my behavior.</l>
<l n="3670"> Moreover, if I sing or joke</l>
<l n="3671"> Or play games in company,</l>
<l n="3672"> It might be to entertain,</l>
<l n="3673"> But it is not at all because of this.</l>
<l n="3674"> One plays well when the heart is troubled</l>
<l n="3675"> In order to attenuate many evil rumors.</l>
<l n="3676"> Alas! Since I am suffering, where would I get the idea</l>
<l n="3677"> To play or to distract myself now,</l>
<l n="3678"> Or to be happy at the right moment,</l>
<l n="3679"> If one understands my situation well?</l>
<l n="3680"> If I am happy in any way,</l>
<l n="3681"> It is right that I am happy with no reason!</l>
<l n="3682"> Without a reason? Truly, do not doubt it!</l>
<l n="3683"> Alas! For I am thrown into the fire of love,</l>
<l n="3684"> Which burns my heart and breaks my body;</l>
<l n="3685"> I am stationed to suffer torments.</l>
<l n="3686"> I cannot make my lady hear me</l>
<l n="3687"> Through any request that I make.</l>
<l n="3688"> Sweet lady, may it not displease you</l>
<l n="3689"> If what I think, which hurts me,</l>
<l n="3690"> I have told you through a guessing game,</l>
<l n="3691"> For I suffer so much both day and night</l>
<l n="3692"> From that which burns my hurt,</l>
<l n="3693"> Whatever comes out of my mouth.</l>
<l n="3694"> Nevertheless, my lady, in all that I have said</l>
<l n="3695"> I have never criticized you,</l>
<l n="3696"> In the hope that everything I fear is nothing.</l>
<l n="3697"> But a sick man or one who is mistreated</l>
<l n="3698"> Criticizes himself through too many thoughts,</l>
<l n="3699"> Sometimes to his disadvantage, sometimes to his advantage.</l>
<l n="3700"> Oh, lady in love through sweetness,</l>
<l n="3701"> I die and languish in life.</l>
<l n="3702"> My heart is blackened with burning</l>
<l n="3703"> If you, very sweet, delicious one,</l>
<l n="3704"> Do not relieve me without waiting</l>
<l n="3705"> And give me hope of mercy.</l>
<l n="3706"> When a man remains languishing</l>
<l n="3707"> And does not have hope—for a day or an hour—</l>
<l n="3708"> That one will rescue him</l>
<l n="3709"> And everyday misfortune surrounds him,</l>
<l n="3710"> I say truly, may God help me,</l>
<l n="3711"> That one can compare this state to death.</l>
<l n="3712"> Lady, you who give me these pains,</l>
<l n="3713"> You make them flourish within me</l>
<l n="3714"> By diminishing my hope for mercy,</l>
<l n="3715"> That I have resigned myself to lamenting;</l>
<l n="3716"> But I have a reason to abandon myself</l>
<l n="3717"> To complaining more than any other.</l>
<l n="3718"> Alas! But what does it mean to complain</l>
<l n="3719"> If in you, lady, to whom I recount</l>
<l n="3720"> My woes, I cannot find any help—</l>
<l n="3721"> If, truly, you do not take any account of me?</l>
<l n="3722"> No misfortune is greater than mine.</l>
<l n="3723"> I can prove that I am devastated!</l>
<l n="3724"> And nevertheless, my lady of high nobility,</l>
<l n="3725"> Because I cannot explain well</l>
<l n="3726"> My distress to you when I am present,</l>
<l n="3727"> So much does the anguish of love constrain me,</l>
<l n="3728"> For this reason, I address myself to you through this dit,</l>
<l n="3729"> Which I give as a gift to you.</l>
<l n="3730"> May you let yourself, noble, courteous and gracious one,</l>
<l n="3731"> Be so acquainted with sweetness</l>
<l n="3732"> That you deign to consider me with pity,</l>
<l n="3733"> For in my heart, through the amorous arrow</l>
<l n="3734"> Of your sweet love is attached to me</l>
<l n="3735"> The burning from which I cannot protect myself.</l>
<l n="3736"> May you do this, if it is your wish,</l>
<l n="3737"> My lady, according to what is appropriate,</l>
<l n="3738"> And envisage following its generosity,</l>
<l n="3739"> For pain holds me because of love for you,</l>
<l n="3740"> And my heart suffers it willingly,</l>
<l n="3741"> If I must die or live through you,</l>
<l n="3742"> I will die in this way without meriting it,</l>
<l n="3743"> Even if my death is not a great loss.</l>
<l n="3744"> It would seem to be very cruel</l>
<l n="3745"> To find pity scarce</l>
<l n="3746"> In a lady who is so noble and intelligent</l>
<l n="3747"> And in whom there is so much sense and beauty.</l>
<l n="3748"> Certainly, no one who looked well</l>
<l n="3749"> At your noble body and your sweet face</l>
<l n="3750"> Would think of this;</l>
<l n="3751"> Rather, it would always be affirmed</l>
<l n="3752"> That Nature was deceitful in you</l>
<l n="3753"> If you were envious or cruel.</l>
<l n="3754"> I do not know what will happen to me</l>
<l n="3755"> But I am completely resigned, my lady,</l>
<l n="3756"> To whatever your will desires.</l>
<l n="3757"> Alas! When this ends in catastrophe,</l>
<l n="3758"> And death comes to me through love for you,</l>
<l n="3759"> It will be for my misfortune that my heart was given to you.</l>
<l n="3760"> My lady, may God not grant that this occurs!</l>
<l n="3761"> But if it is necessary that I suffer death</l>
<l n="3762"> For you, it will not be so bitter for me</l>
<l n="3763"> As long as it comes from your desire;</l>
<l n="3764"> But, through pity, may you remember</l>
<l n="3765"> That I die through my excellent love.</l>
<l n="3766"> And if sweetness is so completely dead</l>
<l n="3767"> That true love leads me to death,</l>
<l n="3768"> In that I will be a true martyr,</l>
<l n="3769"> My lady, in dying it comforts me,</l>
<l n="3770"> And through ardor my heart exhorts me</l>
<l n="3771"> That in waiting for my death I sing:</l>
<l n="3772"> When Fauvel had chattered on hypocritically,</l>
<l n="3773"> Fortune, to whom are revealed</l>
<l n="3774"> The thoughts of men and women,</l>
<l n="3775"> She, who above all women</l>
<l n="3776"> Has the faculty, in all instances,</l>
<l n="3777"> Quickly finds a quarrel with Fauvel</l>
<l n="3778"> For begging her love in this way:</l>
<l n="3779"> “I had told you, long before,</l>
<l n="3780"> That your desire to have me as your wife</l>
<l n="3781"> Was without cause; if you have brayed</l>
<l n="3782"> Enough, let me speak in reply:</l>
<l n="3783"> You cannot choose the best!</l>
<l n="3784"> I am Fortune the feared,</l>
<l n="3785"> The very powerful, the renowned,</l>
<l n="3786"> The very lofty, noble and well bred,</l>
<l n="3787"> And I am the daughter of the very powerful king,</l>
<l n="3788"> In that I am, through my excellence,</l>
<l n="3789"> A property of his essence,</l>
<l n="3790"> With my sister who is so beautiful</l>
<l n="3791"> That Reason calls her Wisdom.</l>
<l n="3792"> And we are, it is true,</l>
<l n="3793"> Of a divine nature,</l>
<l n="3794"> So that we are truly</l>
<l n="3795"> Without ending or beginning.</l>
<l n="3796"> But the intellectual gaze,</l>
<l n="3797"> Not the real one, may God keep me,</l>
<l n="3798"> Gives to my sister, in a very subtle way,</l>
<l n="3799"> A small advantage of age.</l>
<l n="3800"> But one cannot exist without the other.</l>
<l n="3801"> We are seated on the right</l>
<l n="3802"> Of the all powerful, eternal king,</l>
<l n="3803"> The lofty, merciful king of the sky,</l>
<l n="3804"> In his admirable royalty.</l>
<l n="3805"> The angels, in front of our beauty,</l>
<l n="3806"> As well as the saints who arrive in the sky</l>
<l n="3807"> Marvel at it and dwell there.</l>
<l n="3808"> They cannot have their fill</l>
<l n="3809"> Of looking at us and our beings.</l>
<l n="3810"> The more they look at us, the more they contemplate us,</l>
<l n="3811"> And they do not desire anything except to gaze at us.</l>
<l n="3812"> Fauvel, you are crazy and you were crazy</l>
<l n="3813"> When you thought and believed</l>
<l n="3814"> That I was like a woman</l>
<l n="3815"> And that you had to marry me!</l>
<l n="3816"> You were full of a great madness</l>
<l n="3817"> When you thought of such a high marriage!</l>
<l n="3818"> You wanted to lift your comb too high,</l>
<l n="3819"> You who want to marry a royal daughter!</l>
<l n="3820"> You are badly deceived,</l>
<l n="3821"> You who invested yourself in this way!</l>
<l n="3822"> If you had considered well</l>
<l n="3823"> Where you are, where you come from, and what you were,</l>
<l n="3824"> You would never have undertaken</l>
<l n="3825"> Elevating yourself in worth,</l>
<l n="3826"> For you are nothing but excrement and filth,</l>
<l n="3827"> An animal of evil nature,</l>
<l n="3828"> Who exerts great effort in nourishing itself.</l>
<l n="3829"> And soon you will be rotting flesh!</l>
<l n="3830"> You were conceived horribly</l>
<l n="3831"> And nourished in the womb in filth</l>
<l n="3832"> From the most base material</l>
<l n="3833"> That Nature was ever able to make.</l>
<l n="3834"> And when you were inside the womb,</l>
<l n="3835"> You were enveloped in filthy tissues.</l>
<l n="3836"> Your chamber was a tiny space.</l>
<l n="3837"> You were born into dishonor and sadness,</l>
<l n="3838"> And your mother suffered great pain from it.</l>
<l n="3839"> And quickly you began to bray.</l>
<l n="3840"> It is a very bitter birth</l>
<l n="3841"> Which comes in such great misery!</l>
<l n="3842"> And now pride has entrapped you</l>
<l n="3843"> So that you have forgotten all of this.</l>
<l n="3844"> Fauvel, listen well, as is fitting</l>
<l n="3845"> For through you I mean truly</l>
<l n="3846"> The evilness of man and woman</l>
<l n="3847"> Who condemns his soul for the sake of his body,</l>
<l n="3848"> And who, for the deceitful world,</l>
<l n="3849"> Loses God and all enduring good.</l>
<l n="3850"> Consider that even if one combs and rubs you,</l>
<l n="3851"> You are nothing but a sack full of shit.</l>
<l n="3852"> But pride has so overcome you</l>
<l n="3853"> That you do not direct your attention towards anything good.</l>
<l n="3854"> It does not interest you except to exert yourself</l>
<l n="3855"> In having worldly wealth,</l>
<l n="3856"> And you will never be tired of this,</l>
<l n="3857"> Even though you have plenty.</l>
<l n="3858"> And you are a great master in this world</l>
<l n="3859"> And you make everyone graze with you.</l>
<l n="3860"> You are guided only by your desire.</l>
<l n="3861"> You first began a long time ago</l>
<l n="3862"> To be a lord in the world;</l>
<l n="3863"> But you are greater today</l>
<l n="3864"> Than you ever were before.</l>
<l n="3865"> Your cousins are spread everywhere,</l>
<l n="3866"> And your servants and your followers.</l>
<l n="3867"> And I suffer that you lead this kind of life</l>
<l n="3868"> Because I know the secret of God</l>
<l n="3869"> Who, through his reasonable will,</l>
<l n="3870"> Wants that, at the end of this world,</l>
<l n="3871"> There be an abundance of wars, evil and sin</l>
<l n="3872"> Since everyone exerts so much effort</l>
<l n="3873"> To achieve worldly excellence,</l>
<l n="3874"> To serving and loving the world.</l>
<l n="3875"> This is why God plants great bitterness,</l>
<l n="3876"> So that he be able to separate</l>
<l n="3877"> Those who want to satiate themselves too much.</l>
<l n="3878"> And for this reason, I will tell you, without interruption,</l>
<l n="3879"> Along with this, another reason</l>
<l n="3880"> Why evil exists and calamities abound</l>
<l n="3881"> In such great number at the end of the world,</l>
<l n="3882"> Even if he through whom evil arrives</l>
<l n="3883"> Will receive the malediction of God.</l>
<l n="3884"> The author of Six Principles says</l>
<l n="3885"> And Reason does not contradict it,</l>
<l n="3886"> That the world has the name Macrocosm</l>
<l n="3887"> And man is Microcosm.</l>
<l n="3888"> And this signifies and means</l>
<l n="3889"> That there is a bigger world and a lesser one</l>
<l n="3890"> And the one resembles the other.</l>
<l n="3891"> And it is in this way, as it seems to me,</l>
<l n="3892"> That man has four qualities</l>
<l n="3893"> Which have conflict between them,</l>
<l n="3894"> For one is contrary to the other.</l>
<l n="3895"> There is only war in their company.</l>
<l n="3896"> These are moisture, heat, dryness and cold.</l>
<l n="3897"> Heat and moisture devote their attention</l>
<l n="3898"> To conserving and maintaining life,</l>
<l n="3899"> But heat cannot prevent itself</l>
<l n="3900"> From destroying and lessening moisture</l>
<l n="3901"> Without ceasing and in all ways,</l>
<l n="3902"> In the same way as oil destroys the wick</l>
<l n="3903"> Until the lamp becomes dry.</l>
<l n="3904"> Then the lamp loses its light.</l>
<l n="3905"> It is in this manner</l>
<l n="3906"> That natural heat destroys</l>
<l n="3907"> Moisture, and hastens to do so.</l>
<l n="3908"> Dryness also kills moisture,</l>
<l n="3909"> And cold awaits nothing but death,</l>
<l n="3910"> Which comes faster than walking.</l>
<l n="3911"> From these four qualities, Nature formed</l>
<l n="3912"> Four carnal complexions</l>
<l n="3913"> Full of great antagonism,</l>
<l n="3914"> Of which the first is phlegmatic,</l>
<l n="3915"> And then sanguine and then choleric</l>
<l n="3916"> And the fourth is melancholy.</l>
<l n="3917"> From these four was human life,</l>
<l n="3918"> Founded, as Nature</l>
<l n="3919"> Proportions and measures them</l>
<l n="3920"> In natural bodies that have souls.</l>
<l n="3921"> Phlegm is common in children and women.</l>
<l n="3922"> Blood comes to demand its rent</l>
<l n="3923"> At fifteen years until approximately thirty</l>
<l n="3924"> And afterwards comes lady Bile</l>
<l n="3925"> Who holds school until sixty years,</l>
<l n="3926"> Then comes melancholy, quickly,</l>
<l n="3927"> Who joins herself to sadness</l>
<l n="3928"> Through old age which loses</l>
<l n="3929"> Appetite for games because she feels the earth below.</l>
<l n="3930"> And even though women and men</l>
<l n="3931"> Suffer various pains in great number,</l>
<l n="3932"> And many torments in their youth,</l>
<l n="3933"> Nevertheless in old age</l>
<l n="3934"> They have more pain and bad periods,</l>
<l n="3935"> As it follows reason.</l>
<l n="3936"> They become disagreeable,</l>
<l n="3937"> Full of mucous, scabs and eyes full of rheum,</l>
<l n="3938"> Tumors and cough and gout,</l>
<l n="3939"> And many other illnesses make them suffer.</l>
<l n="3940"> This is why sadness strongly assaults</l>
<l n="3941"> The end of man and woman’s life in old age.</l>
<l n="3942"> The same is true, if I am not mistaken,</l>
<l n="3943"> Of the world,</l>
<l n="3944"> For it is made of four antagonistic elements,</l>
<l n="3945"> The world and its organization.</l>
<l n="3946"> These are fire, air, water and earth,</l>
<l n="3947"> Between which there are many wars,</l>
<l n="3948"> For they have very different natures,</l>
<l n="3949"> And are differently made and have opposite wishes.</l>
<l n="3950"> Fauvel, I tell you that at first</l>
<l n="3951"> The world was phlegmatic,</l>
<l n="3952"> And the people who were there,</l>
<l n="3953"> Because of the phlegm many of them had,</l>
<l n="3954"> Were very heavy and weighty,</l>
<l n="3955"> Sleepy, stupid and taciturn.</l>
<l n="3956"> Afterwards the world became sanguine,</l>
<l n="3957"> When David the prophet came,</l>
<l n="3958"> For at that moment intelligence was liberated</l>
<l n="3959"> Which phlegm had covered before.</l>
<l n="3960"> And then the world came to understand</l>
<l n="3961"> That in the Virgin, God would come</l>
<l n="3962"> To take on blood and flesh in order to redeem</l>
<l n="3963"> Those whom Eve had conquered.</l>
<l n="3964"> And then the world became choleric,</l>
<l n="3965"> When God decided to be born from the Virgin,</l>
<l n="3966"> For then the world was hot and dry,</l>
<l n="3967"> When he in whom all goodness abounds</l>
<l n="3968"> Sent dew from the skies</l>
<l n="3969"> Which was so desired;</l>
<l n="3970"> Then the clouds rained with happiness,</l>
<l n="3971"> Which moistened our drought.</l>
<l n="3972"> But now the world has come</l>
<l n="3973"> Into great old age and has become</l>
<l n="3974"> Very full of melancholy.</l>
<l n="3975"> And this is towards the end of its life.</l>
<l n="3976"> Melancholy, I dare to say it,</l>
<l n="3977"> Is the worst of the complexions.</l>
<l n="3978"> It is of a terrestrial nature,</l>
<l n="3979"> So it must be cold and dry.</l>
<l n="3980"> And the world is cold and dry,</l>
<l n="3981"> Full of all kinds of evil and sin.</l>
<l n="3982"> It does not care to amuse itself,</l>
<l n="3983"> For it feels the earth too much.</l>
<l n="3984"> It only wishes to acquire earth.</l>
<l n="3985"> For this reason, misfortune and war result from it.</l>
<l n="3986"> There is no joy or festivity there.</l>
<l n="3987"> All parts of the earth are in a storm,</l>
<l n="3988"> And it is truly reasonable,</l>
<l n="3989"> For, if Scripture does not lie,</l>
<l n="3990"> Signs are appearing that we must be close</l>
<l n="3991"> To the time in which </l>
<l n="3992"> The enemy of Christianity must be born,</l>
<l n="3993"> He through whom all abundance</l>
<l n="3994"> Of evil must come into the world</l>
<l n="3995"> At the time when it must come to an end.</l>
<l n="3996"> Fauvel, you came forward</l>
<l n="3997"> At a fast trot and a slow one,</l>
<l n="3998"> In order to prepare for your master</l>
<l n="3999"> The places where he will be received.</l>
<l n="4000"> You are the courier of Antichrist,</l>
<l n="4001"> His messenger and his harbinger!</l>
<l n="4002"> You have prepared his hotel well,</l>
<l n="4003"> Both for winter and for summer.</l>
<l n="4004"> You are an excellent messenger for him.</l>
<l n="4005"> You are made only in order to go first</l>
<l n="4006"> To prepare for his household.</l>
<l n="4007"> You know very well how to understand and take care of this!</l>
<l n="4008"> You have looked for so many inns for him</l>
<l n="4009"> And acquired so many people everywhere,</l>
<l n="4010"> Who possess neither faith nor love nor truth,</l>
<l n="4011"> That I tell you without lying</l>
<l n="4012"> That it is time that your master come.</l>
<l n="4013"> You have combed so much with your beautiful comb</l>
<l n="4014"> And brushed so much with your brushes</l>
<l n="4015"> That your sons and daughters are everywhere.</l>
<l n="4016"> Fauvel, you should be killed</l>
<l n="4017"> Since you have such an evil lord!</l>
<l n="4018"> Antichrist is your true lord.</l>
<l n="4019"> You are bad and he is worse!</l>
<l n="4020"> You are his valet and his messenger,</l>
<l n="4021"> And you believed that you would marry</l>
<l n="4022"> Fortune, the lady!</l>
<l n="4023"> I am not a wife for such a lackey!</l>
<l n="4024"> When I wish, I will make you</l>
<l n="4025"> Fall and I will leave you impoverished.</l>
<l n="4026"> I did not place great honor in you</l>
<l n="4027"> Because I love or value you,</l>
<l n="4028"> But rather through the divine order</l>
<l n="4029"> Which makes everything balance out.</l>
<l n="4030"> It is true that you will reign for a little while</l>
<l n="4031"> And you will accomplish a great deal of what you desire,</l>
<l n="4032"> But nevertheless you must know</l>
<l n="4033"> That however much you may possess,</l>
<l n="4034"> I will inflict suffering and shame often</l>
<l n="4035"> On several people in your lineage.”</l>
<l n="4036"> “But even though I have a difficult life,</l>
<l n="4037"> I am melancholic</l>
<l n="4038"> In transmitting, this lai in good hope</l>
<l n="4039"> To she who makes me dance in this way,</l>
<l n="4040"> Without mercy.</l>
<l n="4041"> Alas! My heart will be blackened</l>
<l n="4042"> If she does not receive me willingly!</l>
<l n="4043"> I will be placed in the lowest position</l>
<l n="4044"> If what I propose in this lai</l>
<l n="4045"> Is not useful to me.</l>
<l n="4046"> It is therefore time that I proceed</l>
<l n="4047"> Completely, in order to obtain relief: </l>
<l n="4048"> “Stay back, evil Satan,</l>
<l n="4049"> Move away from me, go away! </l>
<l n="4050"> Think, Fauvel, unfortunate one,</l>
<l n="4051"> Of the end, with a pained heart,</l>
<l n="4052"> And of the fact that the visible world</l>
<l n="4053"> Is disappearing quickly into waste!</l>
<l n="4054"> You will not cherish yourself so completely</l>
<l n="4055"> That I do not make you perish</l>
<l n="4056"> And all of your people, each one in turn.</l>
<l n="4057"> You have had too much to drink in great gulps! </l>
<l n="4058"> You live in such luxury that you want to balk at everything;</l>
<l n="4059"> You have destroyed your oats.</l>
<l n="4060"> You do not recognize your lord</l>
<l n="4061"> And you will suffer greater damages!</l>
<l n="4062"> Do you not fear that he considers,</l>
<l n="4063"> At the end, what you have</l>
<l n="4064"> Done before, and that you receive,</l>
<l n="4065"> To your benefit or loss, what you deserve?”</l>
<l n="4066"> Fauvel, despite what he hears,</l>
<l n="4067"> Does not hesitate, however much he hears</l>
<l n="4068"> To respond in this way,</l>
<l n="4069"> As one who is lit up by pride:</l>
<l n="4070"> But Fortune, who does not receive favorably</l>
<l n="4071"> Anything that Fauvel has proposed</l>
<l n="4072"> With this last reply</l>
<l n="4073"> Calms him in this manner: </l>
<l n="4074"> “And this is why, as I have already said to you,</l>
<l n="4075"> For you have made many men fall</l>
<l n="4076"> And succumb to sin and shame,</l>
<l n="4077"> I will give you a brief speech.</l>
<l n="4078"> First, it is ordered that you</l>
<l n="4079"> And your lineage will be</l>
<l n="4080"> Brought into shame and sadness.</l>
<l n="4081"> All born creatures will rejoice</l>
<l n="4082"> For the pains that I will make you receive</l>
<l n="4083"> Will be diverse</l>
<l n="4084"> And conceived through days and weeks;</l>
<l n="4085"> I will accomplish my duty completely!</l>
<l n="4086"> I will make them fall basely,</l>
<l n="4087"> Kill some and capture the others.</l>
<l n="4088"> Some will have injuries and losses,</l>
<l n="4089"> And others will die in poverty!</l>
<l n="4090"> I will make them suffer many evils</l>
<l n="4091"> However much it must displease you,</l>
<l n="4092"> So that the good will have great joy</l>
<l n="4093"> When the wicked follow this path.”</l>
<l n="4094"> Fauvel has listened and heard</l>
<l n="4095"> What the lady has said to him.</l>
<l n="4096"> He is lost, and does not know what he should do.</l>
<l n="4097"> His face is wet from crying</l>
<l n="4098"> And he does not know which path he should take,</l>
<l n="4099"> Nor what the ending to all of this will be.</l>
<l n="4100"> He made the motet that follows</l>
<l n="4101"> But he does not take any pleasure in it!</l>
<l n="4102"> Meanwhile, Fortune decides</l>
<l n="4103"> That she will not attack</l>
<l n="4104"> Fauvel, who is stupefied, any further.</l>
<l n="4105"> She says to him: “Beast of trickery,</l>
<l n="4106"> I do not wish, since you have entered my gates,</l>
<l n="4107"> That you not take away some favor.</l>
<l n="4108"> Behold the beautiful Vainglory,</l>
<l n="4109"> The deceitful maiden</l>
<l n="4110"> Who subtly inebriates people</l>
<l n="4111"> Who wish to live high up in the world,</l>
<l n="4112"> And makes them trust in delights</l>
<l n="4113"> So that they forget themselves and their ending.</l>
<l n="4114"> And long ago she, for the five foolish virgins,</l>
<l n="4115"> Put out their lamps and their candles,</l>
<l n="4116"> For the virginity that they possessed,</l>
<l n="4117"> They had entrusted it to Vainglory completely.</l>
<l n="4118"> The maiden Vainglory,</l>
<l n="4119"> Who is so ephemeral and transitory,</l>
<l n="4120"> Gives drinks so sweetly</l>
<l n="4121"> That one loses all memory completely</l>
<l n="4122"> Of the joy that lasts forever.</l>
<l n="4123"> She is of a very deceitful nature,</l>
<l n="4124"> Vainglory, it seems to me.</l>
<l n="4125"> She has very quickly swept people away</l>
<l n="4126"> With pride and arrogance,</l>
<l n="4127"> And all good things, if she interferes in them,</l>
<l n="4128"> She reduces to nothingness and makes perish;</l>
<l n="4129"> She does not allow people to receive their just deserts.</l>
<l n="4130"> Fauvel, she will be for you, I swear,</l>
<l n="4131"> Too perfect and appropriate a wife</l>
<l n="4132"> For you are vain and she is vain!</l>
<l n="4133"> Go! Marry her and take her away,</l>
<l n="4134"> For I wish and approve it.</l>
<l n="4135"> Go! Take her from beneath my wheel.</l>
<l n="4136"> Then Fauvel, when he heard this spoken,</l>
<l n="4137"> Felt a great joy</l>
<l n="4138"> Thinking, as a result of which he rejoices greatly,</l>
<l n="4139"> That he has made his peace with Fortune.</l>
<l n="4140"> He throws himself directly at Vainglory</l>
<l n="4141"> And proposes to her in the best way that he can,</l>
<l n="4142"> But it was with his left hand.</l>
<l n="4143"> Without announcements, clerk or priest,</l>
<l n="4144"> Fauvel married his wife,</l>
<l n="4145"> Whom Fortune had given to him.</l>
<l n="4146"> Fauvel takes his life and brings</l>
<l n="4147"> Vainglory and takes great pains</l>
<l n="4148"> To serve and honor her.</l>
<l n="4149"> He invited all of his friends, without dawdling,</l>
<l n="4150"> To the wedding festivities,</l>
<l n="4151"> For he wishes to have a great feast.</l>
<l n="4152"> For whoever would follow me</l>
<l n="4153"> About the beauty and painting</l>
<l n="4154"> Of the design and decoration of Fauvel’s palace,</l>
<l n="4155"> I say that in this little book,</l>
<l n="4156"> I acquitted myself at the beginning,</l>
<l n="4157"> But I have not yet showed or told you</l>
<l n="4158"> Where it is, how it sits or what its position is.</l>
<l n="4159"> For this reason I would like, before proceeding,</l>
<l n="4160"> To tell you what I know</l>
<l n="4161"> (For I have thought a little about it)</l>
<l n="4162"> And to tell you about its position:</l>
<l n="4163"> Between two branches of a river</l>
<l n="4164"> Which moisten it, it sits.</l>
<l n="4165"> From the top of the crenellations, one sees</l>
<l n="4166"> The sweet country and area</l>
<l n="4167"> That is called sweet France.</l>
<l n="4168"> And if it is to be described truly,</l>
<l n="4169"> It is seated in the best city</l>
<l n="4170"> Which is established under the sky.</l>
<l n="4171"> All of the others are like cork</l>
<l n="4172"> Compared to this one, whatever one says!</l>
<l n="4173"> The river can be navigated.</l>
<l n="4174"> Through its true name, it is called the Seine.</l>
<l n="4175"> There is no city so renowned</l>
<l n="4176"> In all of Christianity.</l>
<l n="4177"> I think that God grafted Faith there</l>
<l n="4178"> Onto the tree of youth</l>
<l n="4179"> And I have often heard said</l>
<l n="4180"> That the very flower of education</l>
<l n="4181"> Is there, and such a great quantity of people</l>
<l n="4182"> Both from the secular world and the Church.</l>
<l n="4183"> There is no region so rich</l>
<l n="4184"> With noble women until Toulouse.</l>
<l n="4185"> In the palace there are fourteen or twelve</l>
<l n="4186"> Fortresses, towers and little towers,</l>
<l n="4187"> Ready for battle, strong and beautiful,</l>
<l n="4188"> Which helped him in case of need.</l>
<l n="4189"> And, if I do not fear to tell the truth,</l>
<l n="4190"> There is the most beautiful oratory</l>
<l n="4191"> Which can be recalled.</l>
<l n="4192"> One could well call it a chapel,</l>
<l n="4193"> For there is none so beautiful in the world</l>
<l n="4194"> Or which contains such beautiful jewels.</l>
<l n="4195"> He was a perfect lord,</l>
<l n="4196"> He who purchased such relics.</l>
<l n="4197"> No aromatic odors</l>
<l n="4198"> Emit such a sweet scent</l>
<l n="4199"> As does the holy crown</l>
<l n="4200"> That God wore, and the true cross</l>
<l n="4201"> Where he received the mortal wound</l>
<l n="4202"> In order to redeem all of our sins.</l>
<l n="4203"> This is where Fauvel decided to establish himself.</l>
<l n="4204"> This is where Fauvel desired to celebrate his wedding.</l>
<l n="4205"> He did not invite or call for</l>
<l n="4206"> Bishops or abbots bearing crosses:</l>
<l n="4207"> He wanted that, without declining,</l>
<l n="4208"> Carnality his friend come,</l>
<l n="4209"> For he could not do without her.</l>
<l n="4210"> Fornication, Adultery</l>
<l n="4211"> Come there, without saying anything against it.</l>
<l n="4212"> Cupid will come as well as Venus.</l>
<l n="4213"> Of such people, no one remains behind.</l>
<l n="4214"> Gluttony and Drinking come</l>
<l n="4215"> And hope that they are not alone.</l>
<l n="4216"> Inebriation, Excess and Ribaldry</l>
<l n="4217"> Come with them, as well as Lechery,</l>
<l n="4218"> Anger, Fault, Quarrel, Homicide,</l>
<l n="4219"> Hypocrisy, Pride, Acedia,</l>
<l n="4220"> Theft, Discord, Fury,</l>
<l n="4221"> Heresy and Sodomy,</l>
<l n="4222"> Covetousness, Envy, and Lie</l>
<l n="4223"> Do not come there only in dreams.</l>
<l n="4224"> Slander, Deceit, Trickery,</l>
<l n="4225"> Greed and Felony,</l>
<l n="4226"> Ruse and False Seeming</l>
<l n="4227"> Do not go to the party walking,</l>
<l n="4228"> Nor all the rest of the company</l>
<l n="4229"> Of the lineage, counsel and household</l>
<l n="4230"> Of Fauvel, which I have described elsewhere.</l>
<l n="4231"> All come joyfully</l>
<l n="4232"> Both the lenders and the usurers</l>
<l n="4233"> Come down these paths together.</l>
<l n="4234"> They want to be acquainted, forever, with</l>
<l n="4235"> Those gracious and agreeable people</l>
<l n="4236"> Who come. They come from day to day</l>
<l n="4237"> And proceed along the paths from all directions.</l>
<l n="4238"> In the city mentioned above,</l>
<l n="4239"> Each one looks for a place to lodge.</l>
<l n="4240"> Moreover, since I remember</l>
<l n="4241"> Something concerning the palace,</l>
<l n="4242"> I say that it is both a palace and a castle</l>
<l n="4243"> And there is none like it in the world,</l>
<l n="4244"> For there are smaller castles</l>
<l n="4245"> In the surrounding area—</l>
<l n="4246"> More than ten, corresponding completely</l>
<l n="4247"> With the palace and giving it assistance.</l>
<l n="4248"> On the two sides of the main doors</l>
<l n="4249"> Of the palace, there are very strong constructions,</l>
<l n="4250"> And two bridges of very beautiful design.</l>
<l n="4251"> Even the whole kingdom of Castille</l>
<l n="4252"> Is not worth what these are worth!</l>
<l n="4253"> They diverge from believing the truth.</l>
<l n="4254"> Some surely do not believe this, without a doubt,</l>
<l n="4255"> For I am telling the whole truth.</l>
<l n="4256"> One is situated towards the right at noon,</l>
<l n="4257"> The other towards the north. And I say</l>
<l n="4258"> That one goes on these bridges that I describe here</l>
<l n="4259"> To access the city, which is seated</l>
<l n="4260"> Near the island and the area near the cathedral,</l>
<l n="4261"> In a very noble manner.</l>
<l n="4262"> It is the richest city in the world</l>
<l n="4263"> And the place where riches abound the most.</l>
<l n="4264"> It is called Hope.</l>
<l n="4265"> Only the distance of the bridges</l>
<l n="4266"> Separates it from the palace described above.</l>
<l n="4267"> Each man cries out and does not stop crying:</l>
<l n="4268"> “From the palace named Hopelessness</l>
<l n="4269"> Much evil will come, as I expect,</l>
<l n="4270"> Since Fauvel rejoices!</l>
<l n="4271"> Lady of the sky, through what fault</l>
<l n="4272"> Is now base what used to be</l>
<l n="4273"> Called sweet paradise?</l>
<l n="4274"> Is it not very strange</l>
<l n="4275"> That this assembly will be held there?</l>
<l n="4276"> Is there a greater misfortune</l>
<l n="4277"> Than to see such a country metamorphosed in this way?</l>
<l n="4278"> Is there a greater spell</l>
<l n="4279"> Than that things proceed in this way?</l>
<l n="4280"> Is this not more than a misfortune,</l>
<l n="4281"> When from the place where faith</l>
<l n="4282"> Should reign, Fauvel makes his abode,</l>
<l n="4283"> Because of which everyone brays and cries</l>
<l n="4284"> Now that he lives there completely?</l>
<l n="4285"> Oh, Fortune! She turns so sweetly</l>
<l n="4286"> Your wheel when it does not fall faster</l>
<l n="4287"> Onto him [?]! Certainly, this is a great sin!</l>
<l n="4288"> Both, as those who have seen it say,</l>
<l n="4289"> Are situated on a great island</l>
<l n="4290"> In the palace and the area around the cathedral</l>
<l n="4291"> And, through a noble subtlety,</l>
<l n="4292"> One of the edges of the island is occupied crosswise</l>
<l n="4293"> By the palace, when one goes towards</l>
<l n="4294"> The west, in a beautiful way.</l>
<l n="4295"> And the other edge </l>
<l n="4296"> Of the cité, towards the Orient,</l>
<l n="4297"> Includes the mother church in a very noble way.</l>
<l n="4298"> Even though I am pained, sad and mournful</l>
<l n="4299"> Because Fauvel turns everything upside down,</l>
<l n="4300"> The subject that I have taken up, </l>
<l n="4301"> I want to pursue, and finish this book quickly.</l>
<l n="4302"> The jug goes to the water so often</l>
<l n="4303"> That it falls to the ground and is broken. </l>
<l n="4304"> Therefore I tell you, melancholic and defeated,</l>
<l n="4305"> That this false one who conquers everyone everywhere,</l>
<l n="4306"> Because of his evil, he knows that he will be conquered</l>
<l n="4307"> And will end up imprisoned.</l>
<l n="4308"> Before he considers himself conquered,</l>
<l n="4309"> He has undertaken to behave himself</l>
<l n="4310"> In an even more presumptuous manner</l>
<l n="4311"> Than he did at the beginning.</l>
<l n="4312"> All of his relatives, whom he has invited</l>
<l n="4313"> Through letters, have come.</l>
<l n="4314"> I have told you the names of several</l>
<l n="4315"> Above, so I do not want to drone on</l>
<l n="4316"> To repeat them again</l>
<l n="4317"> And it would take too long to write</l>
<l n="4318"> The names of this multitude</l>
<l n="4319"> Of wicked and unpleasant people.</l>
<l n="4320"> They have entered the great halls,</l>
<l n="4321"> Making merry and having large parties.</l>
<l n="4322"> They found Lady Vainglory</l>
<l n="4323"> And greeted her courteously.</l>
<l n="4324"> Each one looks at her with great attention</l>
<l n="4325"> And she deceives them and lures them</l>
<l n="4326"> And makes them fall asleep in the great pleasures</l>
<l n="4327"> Of beautiful rooms and beds</l>
<l n="4328"> And riches which flee like shadows</l>
<l n="4329"> But which weigh one down, the more one possesses them.</l>
<l n="4330"> Fauvel, who wants to throw himself in headfirst,</l>
<l n="4331"> In order to show his arrogance,</l>
<l n="4332"> Has it proclaimed throughout the area</l>
<l n="4333"> That anyone who wishes, that day</l>
<l n="4334"> Or the following four days,</l>
<l n="4335"> To joust, should come without hesitating.</l>
<l n="4336"> There will be no one, however violent,</l>
<l n="4337"> Whether or not he is invited through an announcement,</l>
<l n="4338"> Who is not received at the joust,</l>
<l n="4339"> Which will take place the day after Pentecost,</l>
<l n="4340"> And they who assemble for the joust</l>
<l n="4341"> Will have his favor.</l>
<l n="4342"> About these jousts and the assembly</l>
<l n="4343"> Word has already spread everywhere,</l>
<l n="4344"> So that ladies and maidens,</l>
<l n="4345"> In hearing this extraordinary news,</l>
<l n="4346"> And because the date approaches,</l>
<l n="4347"> Feel impatient about them and are eager</l>
<l n="4348"> To prepare for them and leave</l>
<l n="4349"> In order to see the festivities and the joy.</l>
<l n="4350"> And, in order to better preserve their reputations,</l>
<l n="4351"> They do not wish to delay.</l>
<l n="4352"> But, through a special exception,</l>
<l n="4353"> Ladies of great morality,</l>
<l n="4354"> Namely every single one of the divine Virtues</l>
<l n="4355"> Who have been banished from</l>
<l n="4356"> The domains and lands of Fauvel,</l>
<l n="4357"> Will come to watch the festivities.</l>
<l n="4358"> They are Virginity,</l>
<l n="4359"> Who is of such dignity</l>
<l n="4360"> That it is through her that God deigned</l>
<l n="4361"> To shelter himself in the Virgin to deliver</l>
<l n="4362"> Us from eternal suffering,</l>
<l n="4363"> In a miraculous manner.</l>
<l n="4364"> And she who gave birth as a virgin,</l>
<l n="4365"> Virginity loves her dearly</l>
<l n="4366"> That she will not go there without her</l>
<l n="4367"> Even if she is not very welcome there.</l>
<l n="4368"> Chastity and Religion,</l>
<l n="4369"> Repentance and Confession,</l>
<l n="4370"> Contrition and Penitence,</l>
<l n="4371"> Compunction and Patience,</l>
<l n="4372"> Humility and Simplicity,</l>
<l n="4373"> Obedience and Prayer...</l>
<l n="4374"> Then, without any doubt,</l>
<l n="4375"> Sincerity, Alms and Conscience,</l>
<l n="4376"> Temperance and Innocence,</l>
<l n="4377"> Courtesy and Friendship</l>
<l n="4378"> Kindness and Pity,</l>
<l n="4379"> Perseverance and Charity,</l>
<l n="4380"> Wisdom and Truth,</l>
<l n="4381"> Providence and Mercy,</l>
<l n="4382"> Justice, Loyalty, Concord,</l>
<l n="4383"> Goodness, Joy, Faith, Silence</l>
<l n="4384"> Forgiveness, Fear of God, Knowledge,</l>
<l n="4385"> Moderation and good Generosity,</l>
<l n="4386"> Fairness, Goodness and Prowess</l>
<l n="4387"> And the other sisters, handmaidens of God,</l>
<l n="4388"> Of which there are so many</l>
<l n="4389"> That one would not be able to enumerate them.</l>
<l n="4390"> They will come, without any missing,</l>
<l n="4391"> Not for pleasure or entertainment,</l>
<l n="4392"> But rather to see Fauvel, who, in a brief time</l>
<l n="4393"> Will be horribly destroyed,</l>
<l n="4394"> Unless the beautiful Reason lies,</l>
<l n="4395"> And Fortune goes back</l>
<l n="4396"> On her decision.</l>
<l n="4397"> Nevertheless, if, randomly,</l>
<l n="4398"> Fortune wishes and consents</l>
<l n="4399"> That they have the gift of being able to joust,</l>
<l n="4400"> They will joust in such a way</l>
<l n="4401"> That they will receive a similar gift from God, who gives everything,</l>
<l n="4402"> And who rewards all good actions.</l>
<l n="4403"> Each one of them gives her consent.</l>
<l n="4404"> Even Peace, Patience and Concord</l>
<l n="4405"> Wish to come, to this place that belongs to them,</l>
<l n="4406"> From which Fauvel, led by Antichrist,</l>
<l n="4407"> Has chased them out without a reason.</l>
<l n="4408"> They have sent, for it is the moment,</l>
<l n="4409"> To the city described above</l>
<l n="4410"> Which is called Hope,</l>
<l n="4411"> Humility, who goes ahead to find lodging for them,</l>
<l n="4412"> So that she can find a good inn.</l>
<l n="4413"> Saint Julian, who came to meet her,</l>
<l n="4414"> And generously hosted her,</l>
<l n="4415"> And directed her to a good inn,</l>
<l n="4416"> —The greatest in the valley—.</l>
<l n="4417"> And through true chance,</l>
<l n="4418"> He sent her to people who have always taken care</l>
<l n="4419"> To love the aforementioned ladies,</l>
<l n="4420"> And the ladies loved them as well</l>
<l n="4421"> Without any trace of bitterness.</l>
<l n="4422"> They will be received all the more generously there.</l>
<l n="4423"> The host, whose inn was chosen</l>
<l n="4424"> For the ladies of such worth,</l>
<l n="4425"> As you know, had four names</l>
<l n="4426"> If we pay attention to this:</l>
<l n="4427"> Generous, Courtly, Wise and Kind,</l>
<l n="4428"> And his wife, whose name was Lady Constance,</l>
<l n="4429"> Was good and dignified.</l>
<l n="4430"> She bears the banner</l>
<l n="4431"> Of Loyalty and of Pity</l>
<l n="4432"> Of Sweetness and of Friendship,</l>
<l n="4433"> Of Honor, of Goodness and of Sense.</l>
<l n="4434"> Now I will tell you what I think</l>
<l n="4435"> About the great joy they felt</l>
<l n="4436"> From the desired arrival</l>
<l n="4437"> Of these ladies who take such pleasure</l>
<l n="4438"> In doing good wherever they live.</l>
<l n="4439"> The host, who knew their secret,</l>
<l n="4440"> And knew that they loved him with true love,</l>
<l n="4441"> Had in the nearby burgs and cities,</l>
<l n="4442"> Wealthy relatives and sons and daughters,</l>
<l n="4443"> As well as friends with great power.</l>
<l n="4444"> He wrote to those to whom he was closest</l>
<l n="4445"> And told them to come straight away,</l>
<l n="4446"> Without being frightened or delaying.</l>
<l n="4447"> They tell themselves that it is not appropriate</l>
<l n="4448"> To test them, for the good man</l>
<l n="4449"> Had complete command</l>
<l n="4450"> Over each one of them and the whole group.</l>
<l n="4451"> They begged him to tell them</l>
<l n="4452"> What he wished, and without delay,</l>
<l n="4453"> He will see his wish realized.</l>
<l n="4454"> Then he tells them that, whatever it costs him,</l>
<l n="4455"> They should acquire harnesses and big horses for the joust,</l>
<l n="4456"> Good suits of armor and ornaments,</l>
<l n="4457"> From the best that could be sought</l>
<l n="4458"> And such that no one would be able to find similar ones,</l>
<l n="4459"> And all this for thirty maidens,</l>
<l n="4460"> In great affection.</l>
<l n="4461"> They all proclaim with one cry:</l>
<l n="4462"> “Sir, before it becomes a matter of necessity,</l>
<l n="4463"> You will have everything that is fitting for this project</l>
<l n="4464"> Without anything lacking!”</l>
<l n="4465"> His heart flies and jumps because of this,</l>
<l n="4466"> And he thanks them kindly.</l>
<l n="4467"> After this they depart cheerily.</l>
<l n="4468"> The ladies know with certitude</l>
<l n="4469"> That the moment is arriving fast</l>
<l n="4470"> To depart, for whoever wants</l>
<l n="4471"> To make the trip, so they packed up</l>
<l n="4472"> Everything that they needed. Quickly</l>
<l n="4473"> They begin the journey, without delay,</l>
<l n="4474"> And they traveled so much in the days</l>
<l n="4475"> That they arrived in the city</l>
<l n="4476"> Where they are supposed to stop.</l>
<l n="4477"> Their host, before seeing the sunrise,</l>
<l n="4478"> With a large group of people,</l>
<l n="4479"> Went out to meet them</l>
<l n="4480"> And brings them back to his home.</l>
<l n="4481"> The rumor is dispersed in the air</l>
<l n="4482"> About the safe arrival</l>
<l n="4483"> Of the ladies, whom the host and hostess</l>
<l n="4484"> Love greatly.</l>
<l n="4485"> They brush away the crowds</l>
<l n="4486"> And the ladies take up residence,</l>
<l n="4487"> Which comforts their hosts.</l>
<l n="4488"> They descend and proceed</l>
<l n="4489"> Into the bedrooms, where they</l>
<l n="4490"> Find everything they wish, according to their desires,</l>
<l n="4491"> And then they rest as much as it pleases them.</l>
<l n="4492"> The day of the feast arrived.</l>
<l n="4493"> With faster and slower galloping,</l>
<l n="4494"> People in very noble attire arrive.</l>
<l n="4495"> From the palace, they watch the courtyard.</l>
<l n="4496"> There, they are completely set on doing</l>
<l n="4497"> What they must for this task.</l>
<l n="4498"> Their entourage goes, without delay,</l>
<l n="4499"> To the residences they have chosen;</l>
<l n="4500"> In putting their things in order,</l>
<l n="4501"> There is not a single person who is lazy.</l>
<l n="4502"> They cry out for the cooks, for the tables</l>
<l n="4503"> Are already set, and the tablecloths draped.</l>
<l n="4504"> And the meats were ready—</l>
<l n="4505"> Enough for four of such feasts.</l>
<l n="4506"> The Virtues, who were well prepared,</l>
<l n="4507"> Realized this,</l>
<l n="4508"> And respectfully, with a noble manner,</l>
<l n="4509"> Proceed to the place with the noise.</l>
<l n="4510"> They enter into the halls humbly</l>
<l n="4511"> And behave in a polite manner.</l>
<l n="4512"> There is not one who departs from this path.</l>
<l n="4513"> Everyone looks at them with great desire.</l>
<l n="4514"> Now it is time that I speak to you</l>
<l n="4515"> About Fauvel, who has come up into the palace,</l>
<l n="4516"> And about how he declared aloud:</l>
<l n="4517"> “You who are here, some close and some far,</l>
<l n="4518"> My dear friends, my sweet ladies,</l>
<l n="4519"> It has been a long time,” he says, “since we entered</l>
<l n="4520"> This country and this land.</l>
<l n="4521"> We had to seek a woman</l>
<l n="4522"> For our project, and we did,</l>
<l n="4523"> As it concerns us, as we all know.</l>
<l n="4524"> May everyone have fun and rejoice</l>
<l n="4525"> And lead a pleasant life,</l>
<l n="4526"> Laugh, sing and make merry!”</l>
<l n="4527"> He invites them strongly to do this.</l>
<l n="4528"> Everyone, both men and women, greet him</l>
<l n="4529"> Courteously and thank him.</l>
<l n="4530"> But the Virtues say amongst themselves:</l>
<l n="4531"> “The poor people, how will they sing</l>
<l n="4532"> Now that they have become orphans?</l>
<l n="4533"> Let us suspend our singing.”</l>
<l n="4534"> The trumpeters sound and signal,</l>
<l n="4535"> And quickly everyone washes up</l>
<l n="4536"> And goes to sit at the tables.</l>
<l n="4537"> One could see a great abundance</l>
<l n="4538"> Of good and fine meats:</l>
<l n="4539"> There were capons, goslings, chickens,</l>
<l n="4540"> Swans, peacocks, partridges, pheasants,</l>
<l n="4541"> Herons, bitterns—which are a pleasant meal—</l>
<l n="4542"> And many kinds of venison,</l>
<l n="4543"> Captured by force through running hunting dogs,</l>
<l n="4544"> Stags, deer, rabbits, wild boars,</l>
<l n="4545"> Which live in these woods,</l>
<l n="4546"> And all kinds of good venison.</l>
<l n="4547"> There was an abundance of fish,</l>
<l n="4548"> The best of the whole region:</l>
<l n="4549"> Sturgeons, salmon and plaice,</l>
<l n="4550"> Congers, sea bass, porpoises, brill,</l>
<l n="4551"> Turbots, red mullets and large codfish,</l>
<l n="4552"> Fatty mackerels and large hakes,</l>
<l n="4553"> Fresh herrings and smelt,</l>
<l n="4554"> And so many other fish of the sea</l>
<l n="4555"> As if one had attempted to sow them.</l>
<l n="4556"> There were also many sorts,</l>
<l n="4557"> Fish from ponds and from rivers,</l>
<l n="4558"> Each one prepared with great attention,</l>
<l n="4559"> According to its nature,</l>
<l n="4560"> With green sauce or with cameline sauce.</l>
<l n="4561"> There were pikes in a gelatinous sauce,</l>
<l n="4562"> Large sea lampreys prepared in the same way,</l>
<l n="4563"> And roaches and breams afterwards</l>
<l n="4564"> In a different preparation.</l>
<l n="4565"> And then trout pâté,</l>
<l n="4566"> Chubs and roasted carps,</l>
<l n="4567"> Marinated in verjuice,</l>
<l n="4568"> And large eels in a pastry</l>
<l n="4569"> And roasted in the fire.</l>
<l n="4570"> Sticklebacks in a “chaudume” sauce,</l>
<l n="4571"> As is the custom</l>
<l n="4572"> Of cooks who know the rules</l>
<l n="4573"> For preparing them. There were tenches</l>
<l n="4574"> Which are called “upside down.”</l>
<l n="4575"> There were waffles and wafers,</l>
<l n="4576"> Choux pastry, tarts and flans,</l>
<l n="4577"> Cheese tarts in large heaps,</l>
<l n="4578"> Apples in spices, cakes with cream,</l>
<l n="4579"> Crêpes, doughnuts and fried croquettes.</l>
<l n="4580"> There were good and precious wines,</l>
<l n="4581"> Very delicious to drink:</l>
<l n="4582"> Some were spiced with zedoary, some with rose and other flowers,</l>
<l n="4583"> Well colored wines from Gascony,</l>
<l n="4584"> From Montpellier and La Rochelle,</l>
<l n="4585"> And sweet wines and wine from Castille,</l>
<l n="4586"> From Beaune and from Saint-Pourçain,</l>
<l n="4587"> Which rich people consider healthful,</l>
<l n="4588"> From Saint-Gengoux and from Navarre,</l>
<l n="4589"> From the vineyard called La Barre,</l>
<l n="4590"> From Spain, from Anjou, from Orléans,</l>
<l n="4591"> From Auxerre and from the region around Laon,</l>
<l n="4592"> And from Saint-Jean and the Beauvaisis,</l>
<l n="4593"> French wine and wine from nearby places.</l>
<l n="4594"> There was wine with honey and spices and good claret.</l>
<l n="4595"> The most powerful and the most richly dressed</l>
<l n="4596"> Ate the most gluttonously.</l>
<l n="4597"> They devoured the wines.</l>
<l n="4598"> There was a cook who had devoted all of his attention</l>
<l n="4599"> To making a dish of a very different sort,</l>
<l n="4600"> Without delaying.</l>
<l n="4601"> He made it quickly, fresh and appetizing,</l>
<l n="4602"> With a sauce so spicy</l>
<l n="4603"> That everyone is eager to drink.</l>
<l n="4604"> It was served between the roasts and the dessert.</l>
<l n="4605"> It was tasty and delicious, but</l>
<l n="4606"> Everyone immediately calls out for drink so much</l>
<l n="4607"> That a big barrel of wine must be brought up</l>
<l n="4608"> Into the hall.</l>
<l n="4609"> Everyone, when they see it, laughs and jumps.</l>
<l n="4610"> The barrel is called Shame:</l>
<l n="4611"> Excess draws and gives so much from it</l>
<l n="4612"> That she cannot be called avaricious.</l>
<l n="4613"> One does not wait to wash up</l>
<l n="4614"> In order to drink; but rather drinks in big gulps.</l>
<l n="4615"> In this way, they receive both shame and joy.</l>
<l n="4616"> The fried plate I mentioned above</l>
<l n="4617"> Was made of sins against nature</l>
<l n="4618"> And of all different kinds of other sins</l>
<l n="4619"> Through which the situation has changed</l>
<l n="4620"> To the disadvantage of the good, there where Fauvel resides,</l>
<l n="4621"> Who attacks and overthrows everything.</l>
<l n="4622"> This is the kind of food that people</l>
<l n="4623"> Who are slanderers must eat.</l>
<l n="4624"> This is what people who have power</l>
<l n="4625"> Out of nothing [?] are like—and even worse.</l>
<l n="4626"> Debauchery, who works with spices,</l>
<l n="4627"> Has a very joyful expression there.</l>
<l n="4628"> These are strong spices, strong sweets</l>
<l n="4629"> Composed of the sin of envy,</l>
<l n="4630"> Ardent covetousness and theft,</l>
<l n="4631"> Of pleasure for which everyone thirsts,</l>
<l n="4632"> Which she distributes and delivers everywhere</l>
<l n="4633"> Very generously and without any discussion,</l>
<l n="4634"> And everyone licks his beard.</l>
<l n="4635"> Whoever takes any has a mouth so dry</l>
<l n="4636"> That he must drink immediately</l>
<l n="4637"> And says: “How is it possible that wine does not come?”</l>
<l n="4638"> Then the cupbearer appears, as well as Drunkenness,</l>
<l n="4639"> And each one pours and fills the cups generously</l>
<l n="4640"> And has some poured for each table,</l>
<l n="4641"> Both in the length of the room and the width,</l>
<l n="4642"> With wine in such a great quantity</l>
<l n="4643"> That everyone has complete freedom</l>
<l n="4644"> To get drunk gluttonously.</l>
<l n="4645"> Even Excess, in order to meet demand,</l>
<l n="4646"> Opens the barrel with her mouth.</l>
<l n="4647"> Drunkenness stands so closely to her</l>
<l n="4648"> That the barrel will soon be empty!</l>
<l n="4649"> Everyone exerts great pains in drinking.</l>
<l n="4650"> They will always have drunk shame</l>
<l n="4651"> And spread it everywhere inside,</l>
<l n="4652"> Except near the very gracious</l>
<l n="4653"> Ladies who are the opposite of the Vices</l>
<l n="4654"> Which were discussed above.</l>
<l n="4655"> They have a very modest behavior and are</l>
<l n="4656"> Wise, beautiful, pleasant,</l>
<l n="4657"> They are good listeners and better at keeping quiet,</l>
<l n="4658"> Well educated in honor and goodness.</l>
<l n="4659"> They were seated together.</l>
<l n="4660"> This filthy and porcine people</l>
<l n="4661"> Does not pay attention to them, for</l>
<l n="4662"> From all sides the crowd is so thick</l>
<l n="4663"> That people cannot see each other,</l>
<l n="4664"> And because everyone works</l>
<l n="4665"> At putting shame in his belly.</l>
<l n="4666"> The ladies whose gaze was directed towards God</l>
<l n="4667"> Did not behave in this way ever.</l>
<l n="4668"> They abstained from the food.</l>
<l n="4669"> They looked around modestly.</l>
<l n="4670"> Abstinence and Sobriety,</l>
<l n="4671"> Temperance and Purity</l>
<l n="4672"> And Moderation, who do not bend,</l>
<l n="4673"> Serve them and cut up slices.</l>
<l n="4674"> Neither the wine nor the sweets</l>
<l n="4675"> Come to them.</l>
<l n="4676"> They do not care for any other spices</l>
<l n="4677"> Except for the abundant delights</l>
<l n="4678"> That they had from thinking of God!</l>
<l n="4679"> No one can reproach them for this.</l>
<l n="4680"> Fauvel was seated at the table.</l>
<l n="4681"> In front of him he had his commander,</l>
<l n="4682"> And was seated in the manner of an emperor.</l>
<l n="4683"> There were men with weapons both in front and back</l>
<l n="4684"> To protect this prince.</l>
<l n="4685"> One should burn him in hell!</l>
<l n="4686"> He was dressed in trickery,</l>
<l n="4687"> In a golden fabric and material from Slavic countries</l>
<l n="4688"> In a very noble way.</l>
<l n="4689"> Vainglory was also well dressed,</l>
<l n="4690"> In an excessive manner; </l>
<l n="4691"> She truly resembled a bride!</l>
<l n="4692"> And the others, who had to sit</l>
<l n="4693"> Very close them, were beautiful</l>
<l n="4694"> And adorned with such expensive jewels</l>
<l n="4695"> That each one seems to be royalty.</l>
<l n="4696"> And the other people who stayed outside</l>
<l n="4697"> Behaved very courteously,</l>
<l n="4698"> For they are people of great nobility.</l>
<l n="4699"> Each one makes merry and rejoices</l>
<l n="4700"> According to his station.</l>
<l n="4701"> The hour of Vespers approaches and arrives,</l>
<l n="4702"> And it was time to remove the tables</l>
<l n="4703"> And to play games.</l>
<l n="4704"> The horns sound, both trumpets and bronze trumpets.</l>
<l n="4705"> Viols, bagpipes and chalumeaux,</l>
<l n="4706"> Psalteries, flutes and lutes.</l>
<l n="4707"> There is no one who knew the art</l>
<l n="4708"> Who did not play the minstrel.</l>
<l n="4709"> There were many great melodies.</l>
<l n="4710"> It was time to wash up, so people did,</l>
<l n="4711"> And Fauvel’s people prepared</l>
<l n="4712"> And distributed good spices,</l>
<l n="4713"> Pleasing to all people.</l>
<l n="4714"> It was ginger from Alexandria and India.</l>
<l n="4715"> Afterwards they had poured wine from</l>
<l n="4716"> Calabria for drinking.</l>
<l n="4717"> The hour approached and had already</l>
<l n="4718"> Passed when they should have danced,</l>
<l n="4719"> Played, caroled and amused themselves,</l>
<l n="4720"> Such that everyone, without taking the time to thank anyone,</l>
<l n="4721"> Went off to participate in the carol,</l>
<l n="4722"> Except for those who are strangers,</l>
<l n="4723"> Who have their hearts with God and the angels.</l>
<l n="4724"> These ones behave nobly</l>
<l n="4725"> And come and go at the party</l>
<l n="4726"> In order to clearly observe</l>
<l n="4727"> And then go sit down again.</l>
<l n="4728"> But Fauvel, who secretly</l>
<l n="4729"> Understood their intention,</l>
<l n="4730"> Distributed a secret message instructing that,</l>
<l n="4731"> On pain of death and seizure of goods, no one</l>
<l n="4732"> Should begin </l>
<l n="4733"> The joust without a signal</l>
<l n="4734"> From him or an explicit command—</l>
<l n="4735"> May no one do anything else.</l>
<l n="4736"> But he did not succeed in doing it</l>
<l n="4737"> Without the aforementioned ladies</l>
<l n="4738"> Realizing it; throughout the land,</l>
<l n="4739"> Their people came to look for them,</l>
<l n="4740"> And to see if any good people were there.</l>
<l n="4741"> Towards these ones, they moved quickly</l>
<l n="4742"> In order to say goodbye until the next day.</l>
<l n="4743"> Then they take each other by the hand</l>
<l n="4744"> And descended the steps of the palace,</l>
<l n="4745"> With the intention of going to their inn.</l>
<l n="4746"> At the party, there was no one good</l>
<l n="4747"> Or anyone who did anything worth recounting,</l>
<l n="4748"> Who did not keep their company.</l>
<l n="4749"> Each one cries out in a loud voice:</l>
<l n="4750"> “Behold the renowned ladies!”</l>
<l n="4751"> They escorted them to their inn;</l>
<l n="4752"> May whoever wishes it return to the party. </l>
<l n="4753"> Night arrives, which erases the day.</l>
<l n="4754"> It chases away the party-goers</l>
<l n="4755"> Who see the night approach</l>
<l n="4756"> And that it is time to go to bed.</l>
<l n="4757"> The wine arrives, and each one swallows</l>
<l n="4758"> As much as he wants, and then leaves.</l>
<l n="4759"> [Fauvel] wishes to choose the jousters by name</l>
<l n="4760"> So that Virtue has the worst ones.</l>
<l n="4761"> But much of what the fool wishes remains undone.</l>
<l n="4762"> Their defense is in good hands.</l>
<l n="4763"> He called all of his people</l>
<l n="4764"> And instructed them to do his bidding.</l>
<l n="4765"> He named those who are to joust</l>
<l n="4766"> And showed them what they will do</l>
<l n="4767"> And says that they should prepare immediately</l>
<l n="4768"> Everything they need—they should attend to this—</l>
<l n="4769"> And may everyone ride so well</l>
<l n="4770"> That they are not ashamed of the joust.</l>
<l n="4771"> They leave immediately for this task;</l>
<l n="4772"> They do not need to wait.</l>
<l n="4773"> All of this is known by</l>
<l n="4774"> The ladies, who sing this piece: </l>
<l n="4775"> And afterwards they ask, without an intermediary,</l>
<l n="4776"> For the assistance and aid</l>
<l n="4777"> Of God and of she who is the refuge</l>
<l n="4778"> Of all sinners</l>
<l n="4779"> By singing day and night</l>
<l n="4780"> The words and the song that follow: </l>
<l n="4781"> The maidens do not request</l>
<l n="4782"> Any break, rather they are very attentive</l>
<l n="4783"> To their preparations.</l>
<l n="4784"> Their host, who does not have an equal,</l>
<l n="4785"> Exerts such great efforts for them</l>
<l n="4786"> That one would think he received income.</l>
<l n="4787"> And they, who realize this,</l>
<l n="4788"> Thank God as is fitting</l>
<l n="4789"> In saying these words and these pieces of music,</l>
<l n="4790"> Devoted, with their heads inclined towards God.</l>
<l n="4791"> When it was time to rest,</l>
<l n="4792"> Everyone wanted to go to sleep</l>
<l n="4793"> While awaiting the following day.</l>
<l n="4794"> But, before we go to sleep,</l>
<l n="4795"> I will tell ten or twenty of you</l>
<l n="4796"> About an event that happened that night,</l>
<l n="4797"> For I would like to remain silent about the joust</l>
<l n="4798"> Until the day returns.</l>
<l n="4799"> Fauvel had evil intentions</l>
<l n="4800"> Because of which, at his turn, he will consider himself foolish.</l>
<l n="4801"> Then he said to the most intimate</l>
<l n="4802"> Of the maidens of the bride</l>
<l n="4803"> To have his wife enter</l>
<l n="4804"> The bedroom, and to leave them in privacy.</l>
<l n="4805"> Then they will go to sleep</l>
<l n="4806"> And may they make the others who want to sleep</l>
<l n="4807"> Leave, and then he will enter</l>
<l n="4808"> The place where he will see his wife.</l>
<l n="4809"> This was done, and then he made his entry</l>
<l n="4810"> Into the bedroom, garnished with tapestries,</l>
<l n="4811"> There where there was the beautiful and noble bed.</l>
<l n="4812"> There is none similar from here to Constantinople,</l>
<l n="4813"> So decorated, rich and elegant,</l>
<l n="4814"> With a bedcovering and a quilt,</l>
<l n="4815"> And pillows and rugs,</l>
<l n="4816"> All decorated with designs and representations of</l>
<l n="4817"> Birds, weapons and small animals.</l>
<l n="4818"> All of the images are so clear</l>
<l n="4819"> That anyone can marvel at them.</l>
<l n="4820"> But to give the whole account, there was not, in this place, </l>
<l n="4821"> Either in the hall or in the whole building</l>
<l n="4822"> A monk, clerk or priest,</l>
<l n="4823"> Holy water or a breviary</l>
<l n="4824"> To bless the bed.</l>
<l n="4825"> On the contrary, every single evil spirit</l>
<l n="4826"> Is venerated and cherished there</l>
<l n="4827"> And they will remain close the whole night,</l>
<l n="4828"> Much to their joy and delight.</l>
<l n="4829"> Two ladies whom I admire little,</l>
<l n="4830"> Trickery and Covetousness,</l>
<l n="4831"> Who are the mistresses of the cloakroom,</l>
<l n="4832"> And know well how to proffer lies,</l>
<l n="4833"> Undressed the bride</l>
<l n="4834"> And helped her, completely naked</l>
<l n="4835"> Into the bed, very nobly.</l>
<l n="4836"> She did not need any instruction</l>
<l n="4837"> On how to behave</l>
<l n="4838"> When Fauvel, who has married her,</l>
<l n="4839"> Decides to join her.</l>
<l n="4840"> She will not budge at all,</l>
<l n="4841"> Rather she will be welcoming to him</l>
<l n="4842"> And will suffer all of his actions</l>
<l n="4843"> Humbly, without saying a word,</l>
<l n="4844"> For she wants to prevent him from becoming angry.</l>
<l n="4845"> Fauvel thinks to himself that it is time</l>
<l n="4846"> To go to bed. Without hesitation,</l>
<l n="4847"> He jumps in the bed to sleep with her.</l>
<l n="4848"> But never was there a charivari</l>
<l n="4849"> Of the sort that was made by the riffraff of the streets</l>
<l n="4850"> As one makes throughout the crossroads</l>
<l n="4851"> Of the city, along the streets.</l>
<l n="4852"> There is no man alive under the sky</l>
<l n="4853"> Who would know how to describe it, even a little,</l>
<l n="4854"> Whatever talent he had.</l>
<l n="4855"> Those who create it throw themselves everywhere;</l>
<l n="4856"> They do not fear Fauvel or his people.</l>
<l n="4857"> They are safe,</l>
<l n="4858"> And do not pay attention to their enemies.</l>
<l n="4859"> About the manner and appearance</l>
<l n="4860"> Of the charivari, I will briefly tell</l>
<l n="4861"> The story here,</l>
<l n="4862"> Which is related for the sake of memory.</l>
<l n="4863"> They are disguised in an extravagant manner.</l>
<l n="4864"> Some have dressed themselves</l>
<l n="4865"> In clothing on backwards.</l>
<l n="4866"> Others made their costumes</l>
<l n="4867"> With rough fabric and monks’ frocks.</l>
<l n="4868"> One would have had difficulty picking one out</l>
<l n="4869"> For they were painted and unkempt</l>
<l n="4870"> And had their sights set only on evil deeds.</l>
<l n="4871"> One held a big frying pan</l>
<l n="4872"> And the other the kitchen hook, the grill pan and the</l>
<l n="4873"> Pestle, and another a brass pot,</l>
<l n="4874"> And all imitated a drunkard.</l>
<l n="4875"> Some banged on a basin</l>
<l n="4876"> So loudly that it echoed everywhere.</l>
<l n="4877"> One had cow bells</l>
<l n="4878"> Attached to his thighs and buttocks,</l>
<l n="4879"> And, above, large bells</l>
<l n="4880"> Which produced a clear sound when they were shaken.</l>
<l n="4881"> Another had drums and cymbals</l>
<l n="4882"> And big, filthy and dirty instruments</l>
<l n="4883"> And castanets and “macequotes” </l>
<l n="4884"> From which they drew such high cries and high notes</l>
<l n="4885"> That no one could describe them.</l>
<l n="4886"> One throws himself forward and the other pulls,  </l>
<l n="4887"> Afterwards they pulled a chariot,</l>
<l n="4888"> And in the chariot there was</l>
<l n="4889"> A contraption with wheels from a cart,</l>
<l n="4890"> Very strong, hard and very well constructed,</l>
<l n="4891"> And with each rotation they collided with</l>
<l n="4892"> Six iron bars which struck against</l>
<l n="4893"> The hubs, which were well nailed</l>
<l n="4894"> And well attached. Now hear me:</l>
<l n="4895"> At each collision, they produced</l>
<l n="4896"> Such a great and variable sound,</l>
<l n="4897"> So hideous and horrible,</l>
<l n="4898"> That one would not have heard God’s thunder.</l>
<l n="4899"> And then they cried out</l>
<l n="4900"> In such a way as had never been heard.</l>
<l n="4901"> One exposed his ass to the wind</l>
<l n="4902"> And the other broke a canopy.</l>
<l n="4903"> One broke windows and doors,</l>
<l n="4904"> The other threw salt into a well.</l>
<l n="4905"> One threw shit into the faces [of passersby].</l>
<l n="4906"> They were too hideous and savage.</l>
<l n="4907"> On their heads, they had masks.</l>
<l n="4908"> With them they carried two caskets,</l>
<l n="4909"> In which there were very agreeable people</l>
<l n="4910"> For singing the devil’s song.</l>
<l n="4911"> One cries out “baskets and grain baskets [?]”</l>
<l n="4912"> And the other from the place whence wind comes.</l>
<l n="4913"> There was also a large giant</l>
<l n="4914"> Who processed while crying out loudly.</l>
<l n="4915"> He was dressed in a good, dark cloth.</l>
<l n="4916"> I think it was Hellequin,</l>
<l n="4917"> And the others from his household,</l>
<l n="4918"> Who follow him in a rage.</l>
<l n="4919"> He was mounted on a tall workhorse</l>
<l n="4920"> So fat that, by Saint Quinault,</l>
<l n="4921"> One would have been able to count his ribs</l>
<l n="4922"> And climb them like pieces of wood</l>
<l n="4923"> For covering a roof of tiles or small boards,</l>
<l n="4924"> As if he was returning from exile.</l>
<l n="4925"> It was a horrible thing</l>
<l n="4926"> To behold, I dare to say.</l>
<l n="4927"> With them there were hellequines</l>
<l n="4928"> Who had beautiful adornments</l>
<l n="4929"> And they amused themselves in</l>
<l n="4930"> Singing this lai, which begins:</l>
<l n="4931"> Never had so perfect a charivari,</l>
<l n="4932"> In disguises, words and actions,</l>
<l n="4933"> As this one was in all things, existed.</l>
<l n="4934"> They did not stop</l>
<l n="4935"> Crying or screaming loudly.</l>
<l n="4936"> Fauvel did not seem to notice,</l>
<l n="4937"> Whomever this may have displeased.</l>
<l n="4938"> More than sufficient for him were the pleasures</l>
<l n="4939"> That he had with his wife,</l>
<l n="4940"> Whom he honored as his lady. </l>
<l n="4941"> I would like to return to the joust</l>
<l n="4942"> For I heard the lark sing,</l>
<l n="4943"> Along with the siskin [?] and goldfish</l>
<l n="4944"> Who, earlier than the minstrels,</l>
<l n="4945"> Announce the day and perceive the dawn.</l>
<l n="4946"> It is in this time that the hawthorn</l>
<l n="4947"> And the flowers rejoice,</l>
<l n="4948"> For the birds are trying out their songs,</l>
<l n="4949"> Such as the starling and the blackbird</l>
<l n="4950"> And the thrush around the crenels,</l>
<l n="4951"> And the warbler and the linnet.</l>
<l n="4952"> All of the small birds in a group</l>
<l n="4953"> In the gardens and bushes</l>
<l n="4954"> Make heard their pretty songs,</l>
<l n="4955"> Even those who are placed in cages...</l>
<l n="4956"> And the groves are green,</l>
<l n="4957"> And all of the small animals</l>
<l n="4958"> Who spend the winter underground</l>
<l n="4959"> Come up and show themselves completely.</l>
<l n="4960"> And flowers go throughout the country adorning themselves</l>
<l n="4961"> With new, different colors</l>
<l n="4962"> And young men and women</l>
<l n="4963"> Who are languishing in loyal love</l>
<l n="4964"> Rejoice because of the pretty weather.</l>
<l n="4965"> These birds signal to me, without a doubt,</l>
<l n="4966"> That the dawning of the day chases away completely</l>
<l n="4967"> The night and the power that belongs to it</l>
<l n="4968"> Because of the arrival of the day which appears.</l>
<l n="4969"> When I saw the bright and shining day,</l>
<l n="4970"> I went along, very happy,</l>
<l n="4971"> To the place where the assembly was to occur</l>
<l n="4972"> For the joust, but quickly</l>
<l n="4973"> A very vile group of people,</l>
<l n="4974"> Whom I encountered through bad luck, made me tremble strongly.</l>
<l n="4975"> It was those whom Fauvel had made stay awake</l>
<l n="4976"> In order to prepare them</l>
<l n="4977"> For the joust, and who were there</l>
<l n="4978"> In the fields, completely ready, and were trying out</l>
<l n="4979"> Their big horses and their chargers.</l>
<l n="4980"> To the eye, they were so fierce</l>
<l n="4981"> That I considered them to be crazy.</l>
<l n="4982"> It was clear that the devil</l>
<l n="4983"> Had brought them to this place!</l>
<l n="4984"> It was in the fields in front of the church</l>
<l n="4985"> Of Saint Germain, in a plain</l>
<l n="4986"> Situated between the city walls and the Seine.</l>
<l n="4987"> I willingly gazed at the barriers.</l>
<l n="4988"> They were not made with wood that split easily,</l>
<l n="4989"> But rather with large and strong construction wood.</l>
<l n="4990"> And since I knew very well</l>
<l n="4991"> Where the Virtues were staying, I descended</l>
<l n="4992"> The Seine and, in a small boat, I went</l>
<l n="4993"> To the front of the inn. There, I saw</l>
<l n="4994"> —If I was not lifted into the air—</l>
<l n="4995"> Marvels of the sort that had never existed.</l>
<l n="4996"> For on the inn I saw two ladders</l>
<l n="4997"> Of which the lower ends were propped</l>
<l n="4998"> Against the gables, if we are tracing the lines well.</l>
<l n="4999"> The upper extremities touched the sky,</l>
<l n="5000"> And from there came and went,</l>
<l n="5001"> It seems to me, angels and archangels.</l>
<l n="5002"> I do not tell you this in order to report lies</l>
<l n="5003"> But rather to tell you about the miracle.</l>
<l n="5004"> In the streets there was such a great crowd</l>
<l n="5005"> To see the angels climb</l>
<l n="5006"> That it is a miracle to recount.</l>
<l n="5007"> I think they came to comfort</l>
<l n="5008"> The ladies and then left.</l>
<l n="5009"> And, as it seems to me, they sang</l>
<l n="5010"> This prose all together:</l>
<l n="5011"> It is not right that anyone should be able to hurt</l>
<l n="5012"> The aforementioned ladies, for</l>
<l n="5013"> One would not be able to choose</l>
<l n="5014"> Better ones underneath the firmament. May God never protect</l>
<l n="5015"> Fauvel; may he instead take away his life</l>
<l n="5016"> Because he attacks them in this way!</l>
<l n="5017"> My whole heart rejoiced,</l>
<l n="5018"> And lost all worries and fear</l>
<l n="5019"> When I saw such a very noble and dignified group of people.</l>
<l n="5020"> Never, even assembled by a duke or a king,</l>
<l n="5021"> Had one ever seen a more beautiful one.</l>
<l n="5022"> I did not consider myself unfortunate</l>
<l n="5023"> To have come at that hour</l>
<l n="5024"> Which was already fast approaching prime,</l>
<l n="5025"> Which was the moment for those who had to</l>
<l n="5026"> Joust to go to the place</l>
<l n="5027"> Where the barriers were placed for this purpose.</l>
<l n="5028"> The Virtues, therefore, who had devoted </l>
<l n="5029"> Their attention and energy to jousting,</l>
<l n="5030"> Left, for the success of their endeavor,</l>
<l n="5031"> Their inn. But to tell the truth,</l>
<l n="5032"> Never in the kingdom or the empire</l>
<l n="5033"> Had such beautifully adorned,</l>
<l n="5034"> So noble or well-armed women been seen!</l>
<l n="5035"> God! They have harnesses and tunics</l>
<l n="5036"> And so many nice things,</l>
<l n="5037"> So rich, so majestic, so beautiful,</l>
<l n="5038"> Good, well made and new</l>
<l n="5039"> That every man marvels at them.</l>
<l n="5040"> Lady Holy Mary! How</l>
<l n="5041"> Their chargers are good and beautiful,</l>
<l n="5042"> Strong, elegant, stable and light!</l>
<l n="5043"> They are white, gray, and reddish brown without a trace of tawniness.</l>
<l n="5044"> Each one prays that God will save</l>
<l n="5045"> The women who ride such horses</l>
<l n="5046"> And who encourage each other to behave well.</l>
<l n="5047"> By riding with the reins tightened</l>
<l n="5048"> They arrived straight away at the barriers,</l>
<l n="5049"> Each one with her shield at her neck.</l>
<l n="5050"> There is no man, however much he has lived,</l>
<l n="5051"> Who has seen such powerful lances carried</l>
<l n="5052"> As these women carry. Going to a dance</l>
<l n="5053"> Was not their intention!</l>
<l n="5054"> Each one has the heart of a lion</l>
<l n="5055"> And the desire to be victorious</l>
<l n="5056"> Over Fauvel and Vainglory.</l>
<l n="5057"> They have searched and looked everywhere</l>
<l n="5058"> And nowhere did they see</l>
<l n="5059"> Anyone who seemed to want to joust.</l>
<l n="5060"> They went from place to place so much</l>
<l n="5061"> That they saw Fauvel’s people,</l>
<l n="5062"> By sight, in a very large group,</l>
<l n="5063"> Coming from the right and from the left</l>
<l n="5064"> To the place where the jousts were supposed to occur.</l>
<l n="5065"> Certainly, it would be a great crime</l>
<l n="5066"> If I did not mention in my rhyming</l>
<l n="5067"> That the glorious mother</l>
<l n="5068"> Of the king of the sky, in a great mystery,</l>
<l n="5069"> Descended upon us all from skies</l>
<l n="5070"> In a pavilion which was hung in the air</l>
<l n="5071"> Through God’s wishes.</l>
<l n="5072"> In order to give consolation</l>
<l n="5073"> To the very clean, pure and bright</l>
<l n="5074"> Virginity, whom she holds in great affection,</l>
<l n="5075"> And to those who follow her.</l>
<l n="5076"> The pavilion was so noble and beautiful</l>
<l n="5077"> And of such opulent design</l>
<l n="5078"> That in the whole world there is no mason,</l>
<l n="5079"> Painter or carpenter so wise</l>
<l n="5080"> He could or knew how to describe</l>
<l n="5081"> The brilliant construction of the pavilion.</l>
<l n="5082"> One would have great difficulty in evaluating</l>
<l n="5083"> The wealth deployed in the pavilion.</l>
<l n="5084"> In this pavilion, which is suspended in this way,</l>
<l n="5085"> The Virgin who is called Mary is seated.</l>
<l n="5086"> The Evangelist John and the angels,</l>
<l n="5087"> Apostles, prophets, archangels,</l>
<l n="5088"> Martyrs, confessors, hermits,</l>
<l n="5089"> Chaste widows, chosen virgins,</l>
<l n="5090"> Keep her company</l>
<l n="5091"> To gaze at the Virgin</l>
<l n="5092"> And protect all those who follow her.</l>
<l n="5093"> The pavilion exudes</l>
<l n="5094"> A marvelous and good odor.</l>
<l n="5095"> Virginity and her cousins</l>
<l n="5096"> Approach the pavilion with heads bowed</l>
<l n="5097"> And sweetly, like sirens,</l>
<l n="5098"> Sing these responses and antiphons. </l>
<l n="5099"> A bright light shined down upon them</l>
<l n="5100"> Which left each one surprised.</l>
<l n="5101"> In the light, a voice which spoke</l>
<l n="5102"> Words and explained to them,</l>
<l n="5103"> The ladies in question, their task,</l>
<l n="5104"> But it made my heart ache</l>
<l n="5105"> That I did not understand even though I heard.</l>
<l n="5106"> And then the pavilion disappeared.</l>
<l n="5107"> Truly I tell you—it is not magic—</l>
<l n="5108"> A piece of bread and a barrel of wine</l>
<l n="5109"> Fell from the pavilion to where they were gathered.</l>
<l n="5110"> Two of the maidens took them</l>
<l n="5111"> And gave them to a young man</l>
<l n="5112"> And recommended each other to God.</l>
<l n="5113"> The young man who held them</l>
<l n="5114"> Behaved very nobly.</l>
<l n="5115"> The bread was flesh and life,</l>
<l n="5116"> The wine pure blood, without any deposits</l>
<l n="5117"> From this God who made Aaron’s rod</l>
<l n="5118"> Bloom and wished to die</l>
<l n="5119"> On the cross for us on a Friday.</l>
<l n="5120"> Listen well to what I say:</l>
<l n="5121"> The young man was Gabriel</l>
<l n="5122"> Whom the Virgin, queen of the sky,</l>
<l n="5123"> Had left to nourish them</l>
<l n="5124"> With bread and wine of the celestial king.</l>
<l n="5125"> The young man distributed the bread</l>
<l n="5126"> In such a way that it multiplied</l>
<l n="5127"> For the ladies and all of their people.</l>
<l n="5128"> For each one, afterwards, he poured</l>
<l n="5129"> A drop of wine and they drank it.</l>
<l n="5130"> From this, all of them were full</l>
<l n="5131"> As if they had had a quantity of meat</l>
<l n="5132"> Of the same size as Ireland.</l>
<l n="5133"> Then the ladies kneeled</l>
<l n="5134"> And wet their faces with tears</l>
<l n="5135"> In praising the God of nature</l>
<l n="5136"> For his glorious food.</l>
<l n="5137"> They could use it safely</l>
<l n="5138"> For they accepted it with dignity</l>
<l n="5139"> Without any stain of sin.</l>
<l n="5140"> I know the Gospel well enough to know that</l>
<l n="5141"> Whoever takes the bread in another way</l>
<l n="5142"> Takes it at the peril of his soul.</l>
<l n="5143"> Above, I told you everything in order,</l>
<l n="5144"> So I don’t know what to criticize.</l>
<l n="5145"> I told you the names of the participants</l>
<l n="5146"> And therefore, dear friends,</l>
<l n="5147"> I would go on without reason.</l>
<l n="5148"> Please excuse me for not naming them more</l>
<l n="5149"> For it would be </l>
<l n="5150"> A repetition, as my heart tells me,</l>
<l n="5151"> And it would be useless chatter</l>
<l n="5152"> To describe detail by detail</l>
<l n="5153"> The weapons that they had to wear.</l>
<l n="5154"> If you would like to be amused,</l>
<l n="5155"> I will tell you, in a general way,</l>
<l n="5156"> More than a minstrel</l>
<l n="5157"> Would do in one week.</l>
<l n="5158"> And if I am inspired</l>
<l n="5159"> To compose, I will have great joy,</l>
<l n="5160"> And I will describe the weapons</l>
<l n="5161"> Of some of them, as I know how,</l>
<l n="5162"> But I will speak in the manner of a clerk.</l>
<l n="5163"> The sun, which lights up the earth,</l>
<l n="5164"> Was approaching directly onto Terce,</l>
<l n="5165"> And then appeared</l>
<l n="5166"> Virginity, who has the intention</l>
<l n="5167"> Of obtaining what she seeks.</l>
<l n="5168"> Her people follow behind her.</l>
<l n="5169"> In the barriers, the jongleurs</l>
<l n="5170"> Make so much noise, for whomever this pleases,</l>
<l n="5171"> That it is a marvel to hear.</l>
<l n="5172"> Jongleurs do not know how to distance themselves</l>
<l n="5173"> From there where they see profit.</l>
<l n="5174"> They know well that the Virtues are safer</l>
<l n="5175"> Than these sodomites,</l>
<l n="5176"> Whom they do not value at all,</l>
<l n="5177"> And all of their assaults.</l>
<l n="5178"> These are people whom God hates,</l>
<l n="5179"> And soon they will have what they desire</l>
<l n="5180"> For they quickly saw Fauvel’s people,</l>
<l n="5181"> Coming to the spot for the task</l>
<l n="5182"> As a result of which they will experience shame.</l>
<l n="5183"> Fauvel was in the master bedroom</l>
<l n="5184"> Where there were pillars of marble and amber</l>
<l n="5185"> With big windows that looked over</l>
<l n="5186"> The place where the jousts are delayed.</l>
<l n="5187"> He went out, and his wife with him,</l>
<l n="5188"> But it did not please him</l>
<l n="5189"> That the Virtues had arrived, as one would wish,</l>
<l n="5190"> So beautiful, and all of their good humor</l>
<l n="5191"> Was deflated. They said that it would be good</l>
<l n="5192"> To see how things happened from up close.</l>
<l n="5193"> Vigor, Justice and Boldness,</l>
<l n="5194"> Because of their goodness and their nobility,</l>
<l n="5195"> Through the speech and judgment</l>
<l n="5196"> Of sovereign Wisdom</l>
<l n="5197"> Were put in charge of protecting the party</l>
<l n="5198"> From baseness and irritating behavior,</l>
<l n="5199"> And, for this reason, they make the crowd disperse.</l>
<l n="5200"> Now I will tell you my impression</l>
<l n="5201"> Of the weapons that the Vices have.</l>
<l n="5202"> They are full of ill will.</l>
<l n="5203"> They all behave as one in one task:</l>
<l n="5204"> Doing evil and treating people badly.</l>
<l n="5205"> They all spend their lives in filth</l>
<l n="5206"> And it is reasonable and right</l>
<l n="5207"> That they have filthy equipment,</l>
<l n="5208"> Even though they have enough money.</l>
<l n="5209"> They have false shields and black weapons</l>
<l n="5210"> Painted with souls in tears which</l>
<l n="5211"> Melt in fire and in flames.</l>
<l n="5212"> Their banners are made of infamy,</l>
<l n="5213"> Painted with great serpents</l>
<l n="5214"> Which gnaw on the sides and the breasts</l>
<l n="5215"> Of the condemned.</l>
<l n="5216"> And whoever will ask me now</l>
<l n="5217"> About harnesses and ornaments</l>
<l n="5218"> That they have, they are black and gray,</l>
<l n="5219"> Painted in such ugly colors</l>
<l n="5220"> That it would be painful to speak of them!</l>
<l n="5221"> Their lances and their banners</l>
<l n="5222"> Are decorated with little devils</l>
<l n="5223"> Made out of pure filth,</l>
<l n="5224"> With bands of pride and venom,</l>
<l n="5225"> And other strange ornaments</l>
<l n="5226"> Which I don’t know how to describe.</l>
<l n="5227"> But through a special prerogative,</l>
<l n="5228"> Carnality, the burning and strong one,</l>
<l n="5229"> And those whom Fauvel has named</l>
<l n="5230"> For the joust are better armed</l>
<l n="5231"> Than their companions, truly.</l>
<l n="5232"> I would like to move quickly</l>
<l n="5233"> And tell how beautiful and elegant are</l>
<l n="5234"> The Virtues on their horses.</l>
<l n="5235"> They have some weapons and harnesses</l>
<l n="5236"> Whiter than the snow in winter</l>
<l n="5237"> And sparkling with silver and gold.</l>
<l n="5238"> In 1316,</l>
<l n="5239"> One had not seen such nobility</l>
<l n="5240"> In worth, beauty and richness</l>
<l n="5241"> As in their weapons and ornaments.</l>
<l n="5242"> There were precious gems of many sorts.</l>
<l n="5243"> Their tunics were strewn with</l>
<l n="5244"> The best and the most authentic.</l>
<l n="5245"> The bits, protective headgear and saddles</l>
<l n="5246"> Were decorated beautifully</l>
<l n="5247"> With good and beautiful emeralds.</l>
<l n="5248"> There were many pink rubies</l>
<l n="5249"> And also many topazes.</l>
<l n="5250"> Never, for so many people in so little space,</l>
<l n="5251"> Had so much wealth as there was there</l>
<l n="5252"> Ever been seen or known!</l>
<l n="5253"> Sapphires, pearls and diamonds</l>
<l n="5254"> Which are appropriate for true lovers,</l>
<l n="5255"> Were not lacking there.</l>
<l n="5256"> Whoever would wish to contradict this is wrong.</l>
<l n="5257"> There were some among them </l>
<l n="5258"> Who wore brown weapons,</l>
<l n="5259"> Engraved with silver and gold.</l>
<l n="5260"> In dreaming when I sleep, it seems to me</l>
<l n="5261"> That I see their noble comportment</l>
<l n="5262"> Because of the banner [?] which I hold in my hand!</l>
<l n="5263"> There were blue ones</l>
<l n="5264"> Strewn with lily flowers in gold.</l>
<l n="5265"> Others with upright lions in gules</l>
<l n="5266"> With white. There is no man</l>
<l n="5267"> Who could record them all</l>
<l n="5268"> Or describe them without raising doubt.</l>
<l n="5269"> Virginity pursues and leads</l>
<l n="5270"> This task sovereignly,</l>
<l n="5271"> And is the best dressed</l>
<l n="5272"> And the most beautifully armed.</l>
<l n="5273"> She had white and pure weapons</l>
<l n="5274"> Strewn with gold and depicting</l>
<l n="5275"> Very beautiful small angels.</l>
<l n="5276"> Never were Tristan and Lancelot</l>
<l n="5277"> Ever better adorned!</l>
<l n="5278"> One would have difficulty in evaluating</l>
<l n="5279"> The value of the noble group.</l>
<l n="5280"> But I especially prize</l>
<l n="5281"> A very large, dapple-gray charger,</l>
<l n="5282"> With a large chest and a large croup,</l>
<l n="5283"> Beautiful, a marvel without equal,</l>
<l n="5284"> On which she was seated. Completely red</l>
<l n="5285"> Was the covering of the horse,</l>
<l n="5286"> Strewn intelligently</l>
<l n="5287"> With beautiful and clear little bells</l>
<l n="5288"> Of silver and white rosettes.</l>
<l n="5289"> And the rest of the charger’s equipment,</l>
<l n="5290"> The saddle, the straps, the chest covering and the stirrups</l>
<l n="5291"> Were made completely in gold and silk</l>
<l n="5292"> And, may I not be a liar,</l>
<l n="5293"> On it was an embroidery with pearls</l>
<l n="5294"> Much to the chagrin of hypocrites.</l>
<l n="5295"> There was a shield of expensive construction.</l>
<l n="5296"> Whoever made it in this way</l>
<l n="5297"> Was not greedy or avaricious.</l>
<l n="5298"> The construction was made of pure silver,</l>
<l n="5299"> Strewn with big pearls from the Orient</l>
<l n="5300"> As far as I know;</l>
<l n="5301"> It was made through divine manufacture,</l>
<l n="5302"> For in the world, no man would be able</l>
<l n="5303"> To create such a fine work.</l>
<l n="5304"> I know well, without guessing,</l>
<l n="5305"> That she had a strong and solid lance</l>
<l n="5306"> Which could have been constructed for the king</l>
<l n="5307"> Of whatever kingdom you wish.</l>
<l n="5308"> To the side of Virginity</l>
<l n="5309"> Had slipped heralds with trumpets and they say</l>
<l n="5310"> That they are very upset that they cannot announce</l>
<l n="5311"> The joust, for the start time has passed.</l>
<l n="5312"> And Virginity, without hesitation</l>
<l n="5313"> Went to stand in the place which was hers.</l>
<l n="5314"> Now listen to your profit [?]:</l>
<l n="5315"> With these sane weapons were armed,</l>
<l n="5316"> So that everyone perceived it,</l>
<l n="5317"> Chastity and Religion,</l>
<l n="5318"> Repentance, Confession,</l>
<l n="5319"> Penitence and Abstinence,</l>
<l n="5320"> Honesty and Benevolence</l>
<l n="5321"> And around a hundred true virgins</l>
<l n="5322"> —No similar ones exist, I think,</l>
<l n="5323"> For they are too rare now.</l>
<l n="5324"> With them were the abovementioned</l>
<l n="5325"> Virtues, who seemed angry</l>
<l n="5326"> That they were not assembling.</l>
<l n="5327"> She chose Carnality,</l>
<l n="5328"> And burns to joust with her.</l>
<l n="5329"> Carnality knew very well</l>
<l n="5330"> —Or I am completely stupid—</l>
<l n="5331"> That Virginity wanted</l>
<l n="5332"> To do this. She had a strong, fast</l>
<l n="5333"> Horse that was brown.</l>
<l n="5334"> She did not esteem Virginity</l>
<l n="5335"> Even a little, in her impatience.</l>
<l n="5336"> She valued her own worth!</l>
<l n="5337"> She was clothed in and wore shoes of iron,</l>
<l n="5338"> As is fitting for equipment.</l>
<l n="5339"> She had a shield of sable with a head</l>
<l n="5340"> That has sent many men into misfortune</l>
<l n="5341"> Through insane gazes and depraved pleasures.</l>
<l n="5342"> As a tunic she had a surplice</l>
<l n="5343"> Black like a blackberry, with bezants of gold.</l>
<l n="5344"> She had many other weapons</l>
<l n="5345"> Of this same sort.</l>
<l n="5346"> She was adorned with sudden death.</l>
<l n="5347"> It seemed that she was very angry.</l>
<l n="5348"> She took up her lance and set her sights on Virginity,</l>
<l n="5349"> And returned straight away to the barriers</l>
<l n="5350"> Where there were more than twenty vices.</l>
<l n="5351"> Virginity, who was waiting for her,</l>
<l n="5352"> Gave her such a speech:</l>
<l n="5353"> “Ride, evil whore!”</l>
<l n="5354"> Then Carnality turned her face </l>
<l n="5355"> Towards her</l>
<l n="5356"> And let herself run, </l>
<l n="5357"> But Virginity strikes her breasts</l>
<l n="5358"> So that she falls down tumbling</l>
<l n="5359"> To the ground, completely astonished.</l>
<l n="5360"> Adultery lifts her up</l>
<l n="5361"> And a herald cries out loudly</l>
<l n="5362"> And mocks her, whomever this might displease,</l>
<l n="5363"> For she is strongly armed</l>
<l n="5364"> And mounted on a very big charger.</l>
<l n="5365"> This was not a misfortune for the herald,</l>
<l n="5366"> For the horse from which she fell,</l>
<l n="5367"> Virginity gave it to him immediately.</l>
<l n="5368"> Carnality calls out to </l>
<l n="5369"> Virginity, for she now</l>
<l n="5370"> Wants to joust—this is to her misfortune!</l>
<l n="5371"> Virginity realized</l>
<l n="5372"> That her lance had not broken</l>
<l n="5373"> In the other assault, and she became emotional.</l>
<l n="5374"> When she saw Carnality</l>
<l n="5375"> Coming, she does not hesitate to move.</l>
<l n="5376"> She gave such a blow to the bastard</l>
<l n="5377"> With her lance, which was strong and solid,</l>
<l n="5378"> That she knocked her from her horse, and she was cold,</l>
<l n="5379"> On the ground, completely stunned.</l>
<l n="5380"> This blow broke her lance.</l>
<l n="5381"> Turning around, she saw Adultery;</l>
<l n="5382"> She has reason and will</l>
<l n="5383"> To joust with her, and the same is true for</l>
<l n="5384"> Adultery, on whom it weighed</l>
<l n="5385"> That Carnality was defeated.</l>
<l n="5386"> He desires that this day</l>
<l n="5387"> Bring troubles to Virginity.</l>
<l n="5388"> Then Virginity’s joy</l>
<l n="5389"> Began to double.</l>
<l n="5390"> And the heralds cry out: “Saint Denis Montjoie!”</l>
<l n="5391"> Because they see their advantage.</l>
<l n="5392"> Adultery had, and it was sufficient for him,</l>
<l n="5393"> A strong charger who was well trained.</l>
<l n="5394"> He was well equipped with weapons</l>
<l n="5395"> That were very filthy, as is fitting.</l>
<l n="5396"> He was wearing a strong gambeson</l>
<l n="5397"> That Luxuria had given him,</l>
<l n="5398"> Clumsily painted and sewn.</l>
<l n="5399"> And his head was protected with a helmet</l>
<l n="5400"> That had been suspended in smoke,</l>
<l n="5401"> As I am persuaded, for a year and a half.</l>
<l n="5402"> He seemed to be a devil.</l>
<l n="5403"> He was carrying a post instead of a lance</l>
<l n="5404"> And, through a great misfortune,</l>
<l n="5405"> He had a shield made out of a brothel door.</l>
<l n="5406"> Everyone made a large and wide path for him</l>
<l n="5407"> So that he could come to the barriers.</l>
<l n="5408"> He imagined he could behave honorably,</l>
<l n="5409"> And he rushes quickly forward.</l>
<l n="5410"> He is not upset about this!</l>
<l n="5411"> Virginity, who chose him,</l>
<l n="5412"> Asked him what was wrong</l>
<l n="5413"> And he said he could not escape</l>
<l n="5414"> The joust. Then he began to spur</l>
<l n="5415"> His big horse.</l>
<l n="5416"> He turned his head in all directions like a heron</l>
<l n="5417"> And turned towards Virginity</l>
<l n="5418"> But Virginity times her attack so wisely</l>
<l n="5419"> That when he approaches</l>
<l n="5420"> She almost knocked him out</l>
<l n="5421"> With her lance which she jabbed</l>
<l n="5422"> Into his face, so that he fell</l>
<l n="5423"> To the ground, where he fell so hard</l>
<l n="5424"> That he cried out: “There is little straw here!”</l>
<l n="5425"> Fauvel knows this, and is disappointed.</l>
<l n="5426"> He comes to the joust without delay</l>
<l n="5427"> With a large group of followers,</l>
<l n="5428"> All full of vice.</l>
<l n="5429"> But before he arrived at the place,</l>
<l n="5430"> Things transpired</l>
<l n="5431"> So that two of his own, whom he esteemed</l>
<l n="5432"> Greatly, were covered in shame.</l>
<l n="5433"> Chastity had obtained permission</l>
<l n="5434"> From those who had power in this matter</l>
<l n="5435"> To go joust with Fornication</l>
<l n="5436"> —This was her intention—.</l>
<l n="5437"> She is not troubled about this.</l>
<l n="5438"> Rather, her joy is doubled.</l>
<l n="5439"> She sees her and prepares herself,</l>
<l n="5440"> And Fornication comes to attention.</l>
<l n="5441"> Each one laces up their helmet</l>
<l n="5442"> And comes to the spot of the joust.</l>
<l n="5443"> Chastity holds her lance and attaches it,</l>
<l n="5444"> With her shield at her neck and, whomever it might displease,</l>
<l n="5445"> She struck her adversary in such a way</l>
<l n="5446"> That she would have expired on the spot</l>
<l n="5447"> Were it not for lady Destiny</l>
<l n="5448"> Who prolonged her life.</l>
<l n="5449"> However, she fell completely supine</l>
<l n="5450"> With Fauvel’s followers looking on.</l>
<l n="5451"> Humility, the friend of God,</l>
<l n="5452"> Was not very far from the barriers.</l>
<l n="5453"> She was richly armed.</l>
<l n="5454"> Her decorations were completely white</l>
<l n="5455"> And drawn and designed in the same way</l>
<l n="5456"> As Virginity, her mother.</l>
<l n="5457"> No one would be able, if one wants to speak the truth,</l>
<l n="5458"> To describe lady Humility</l>
<l n="5459"> Or the way her goodness of worth</l>
<l n="5460"> Reduced to nothingness the flames</l>
<l n="5461"> Of Pride. And Arrogance</l>
<l n="5462"> Has a great desire and wish</l>
<l n="5463"> To confront her, but</l>
<l n="5464"> Abstinence and Pity have already made the following arrangement:</l>
<l n="5465"> They will ask Humility,</l>
<l n="5466"> As a gift, </l>
<l n="5467"> For the maiden Patience,</l>
<l n="5468"> That she be given permission</l>
<l n="5469"> To go joust against Pride</l>
<l n="5470"> And, with God’s help, that she not fail in this enterprise.</l>
<l n="5471"> Humility, because of their request,</l>
<l n="5472"> And because Patience</l>
<l n="5473"> Held her banner before her,</l>
<l n="5474"> Granted this publicly.</l>
<l n="5475"> She would not accept in exchange all the wealth of Bourgueil,</l>
<l n="5476"> Patience, who, without arrogance,</l>
<l n="5477"> Wants to joust against Pride.</l>
<l n="5478"> She does not wish to fight with anyone else.</l>
<l n="5479"> She carried weapons like her mistress.</l>
<l n="5480"> In the middle of the crowd, she chose</l>
<l n="5481"> Pride, who has a great following.</l>
<l n="5482"> Even in one day, I would never be able</l>
<l n="5483"> To describe his expensive weapons,</l>
<l n="5484"> But they are opulent and ostentatious.</l>
<l n="5485"> Each one knows the other’s intentions,</l>
<l n="5486"> So they take their path in the ranks.</l>
<l n="5487"> All collectively praised</l>
<l n="5488"> Patience, for she humbly</l>
<l n="5489"> Came and in such a graceful manner.</l>
<l n="5490"> But Pride becomes so unrestrained</l>
<l n="5491"> That it seems that everything belongs to him.</l>
<l n="5492"> Patience knows very well</l>
<l n="5493"> That through patiently waiting, one obtains victory,</l>
<l n="5494"> As long as one remembers</l>
<l n="5495"> To seize the opportunity for profit</l>
<l n="5496"> When the occasion and moment present themselves.</l>
<l n="5497"> Pride hears only Vainglory.</l>
<l n="5498"> Patience, believe this,</l>
<l n="5499"> Does not think about such things.</l>
<l n="5500"> Her charger goes faster than a trot</l>
<l n="5501"> To get into place.</l>
<l n="5502"> She laces her helmet, which is of good quality,</l>
<l n="5503"> And she puts her shield onto her arm.</l>
<l n="5504"> She picks up her lance and then turns her face</l>
<l n="5505"> Towards her adversary.</l>
<l n="5506"> One rushes towards the other with a fierce heart</l>
<l n="5507"> And they broke their lances in the encounter.</l>
<l n="5508"> The horns sound and the trumpeters trumpet</l>
<l n="5509"> And everyone returns to their side.</l>
<l n="5510"> Patience does not fear</l>
<l n="5511"> Pride, or all of his arrogance.</l>
<l n="5512"> She does not attempt to flatter him,</l>
<l n="5513"> For in the following match, she gives him</l>
<l n="5514"> Such a blow with her lance that help</l>
<l n="5515"> Is no longer useful to him.</l>
<l n="5516"> He was struck in the throat</l>
<l n="5517"> In such a way that in falling to the ground</l>
<l n="5518"> He broke his neck bone.</l>
<l n="5519"> Through reason and good judgment,</l>
<l n="5520"> The ladies asked</l>
<l n="5521"> Patience to rest.</l>
<l n="5522"> Abstinence wants, but does not dare,</l>
<l n="5523"> To joust without permission.</l>
<l n="5524"> With a delighted heart she obtained it</l>
<l n="5525"> And advanced immediately and prepared herself.</l>
<l n="5526"> Gluttony leaps with great anger,</l>
<l n="5527"> Spurs and kicks her horse</l>
<l n="5528"> And shows herself with force throughout the valley.</l>
<l n="5529"> She wants to make Abstinence afraid</l>
<l n="5530"> But, by the name of He whom I adore,</l>
<l n="5531"> And of She for whom I sing,</l>
<l n="5532"> This one does not delight in anything</l>
<l n="5533"> Except in the arrival of Gluttony, without delay.</l>
<l n="5534"> She waits for her on her steed;</l>
<l n="5535"> She does not seek anything else.</l>
<l n="5536"> She declares that the joust </l>
<l n="5537"> Between the two of them is appropriate and reasonable.</l>
<l n="5538"> Gluttony, with sable weapons,</l>
<l n="5539"> Joins her line and takes up her lance</l>
<l n="5540"> And then Abstinence advances.</l>
<l n="5541"> Her horse rushes forward and the other as well.</l>
<l n="5542"> They give each other such beautiful blows</l>
<l n="5543"> That, at the moment of impact, they are positioned</l>
<l n="5544"> So that both of them break their lances.</l>
<l n="5545"> But Abstinence, in the last attack,</l>
<l n="5546"> Hits Lady Gluttony </l>
<l n="5547"> With her banner in such a way</l>
<l n="5548"> That she becomes clumsy and does not take this as a joke,</l>
<l n="5549"> Although she held herself on the steed.</l>
<l n="5550"> She returned to her line with a fierce desire</l>
<l n="5551"> To go to the third round.</l>
<l n="5552"> Abstinence does not remain in place,</l>
<l n="5553"> But rather rushes in a straight line</l>
<l n="5554"> Towards Gluttony, whomever this might irritate,</l>
<l n="5555"> And strikes her in an exposed place</l>
<l n="5556"> So that she opens her shoulder.</l>
<l n="5557"> She fell to the ground in a faint.</l>
<l n="5558"> Fauvel’s people picked her up</l>
<l n="5559"> And brought her back to their lodges.</l>
<l n="5560"> They would have wished to be in Limoges,</l>
<l n="5561"> Those who had dressed themselves in iron for Fauvel,</l>
<l n="5562"> But it was too late to repent!</l>
<l n="5563"> Truth could not prevent herself</l>
<l n="5564"> From discovering the depths</l>
<l n="5565"> Of her thoughts. She does not seek any detour</l>
<l n="5566"> And comes straight to Fauvel: “Be careful I don’t strangle you,”</l>
<l n="5567"> She said, “you very evil rascal!</l>
<l n="5568"> Why do you not jump onto a saddle as well?</l>
<l n="5569"> Why did you not leave for your wedding celebrations?</l>
<l n="5570"> One would prepare for you wild plums</l>
<l n="5571"> Of the sort that a little would suffice,</l>
<l n="5572"> And you would already be broken into so many pieces</l>
<l n="5573"> That nothing would be able to save you!</l>
<l n="5574"> It would have pleased me if things had gone this way!</l>
<l n="5575"> Fauvel leaves, fleeing,</l>
<l n="5576"> And Vainglory with her big cape,</l>
<l n="5577"> Angered because of her brief shame,</l>
<l n="5578"> And comes close to lashing out.</l>
<l n="5579"> The heralds cry: “Vacate the premises!</l>
<l n="5580"> The dice are now against you.</l>
<l n="5581"> Your situation has changed.</l>
<l n="5582"> You no longer have trumpets or tambourines!”</l>
<l n="5583"> No one remains who does not take his leave.</l>
<l n="5584"> Everyone shows his pleasure towards the ladies.</l>
<l n="5585"> The group of minstrels</l>
<l n="5586"> Runs towards them and assembles there.</l>
<l n="5587"> Everyone makes merry</l>
<l n="5588"> In the valley and plains.</l>
<l n="5589"> From their honor it is apparent that Fortune,</l>
<l n="5590"> Who controls each and every person,</l>
<l n="5591"> Has come to despise Fauvel’s people</l>
<l n="5592"> And that she is now on the side</l>
<l n="5593"> Of the gracious maidens</l>
<l n="5594"> Who suffer for us, and not for themselves.</l>
<l n="5595"> On the part of the ladies, there was nothing but anger</l>
<l n="5596"> When they had to put down</l>
<l n="5597"> Their lances, for they had no other care</l>
<l n="5598"> But to defeat</l>
<l n="5599"> Those who intended to joust</l>
<l n="5600"> And who had not yet jousted.</l>
<l n="5601"> And, after all, if Fortune had not come into existence</l>
<l n="5602"> And if it had not displeased her,</l>
<l n="5603"> Whoever would have lost or perished from this,</l>
<l n="5604"> Things would have ended with the exchange of blows,</l>
<l n="5605"> Not in jousting, but in war,</l>
<l n="5606"> Which, for as long as God wishes</l>
<l n="5607"> To let men live on earth,</l>
<l n="5608"> Will go on between them without respite.</l>
<l n="5609"> Fortune descended to earth.</l>
<l n="5610"> She deliberated at length</l>
<l n="5611"> And sought counsel with Virginity,</l>
<l n="5612"> Wisdom and Equity</l>
<l n="5613"> And with all of their companions. </l>
<l n="5614"> Through their advice, it was decided that</l>
<l n="5615"> The jousts should be delayed, for the present moment,</l>
<l n="5616"> For Fortune, as I believe,</l>
<l n="5617"> Showed them truly </l>
<l n="5618"> That, however long Fauvel’s</l>
<l n="5619"> Judgment was delayed,</l>
<l n="5620"> He would come to a bad end</l>
<l n="5621"> At the time that was destined for him.</l>
<l n="5622"> But before this, he will have plotted</l>
<l n="5623"> Against several people and created many</l>
<l n="5624"> Scandals, resulting in great damage,</l>
<l n="5625"> And he will have an abundance</l>
<l n="5626"> Of wealth and his reign will continue.</l>
<l n="5627"> “You will bear this with patience</l>
<l n="5628"> And you will do all the good that you can</l>
<l n="5629"> In the world, in your heritage,</l>
<l n="5630"> For love of the human race</l>
<l n="5631"> Which is so fragile and perverse</l>
<l n="5632"> That, if not for your guidance,</l>
<l n="5633"> It will lose eternal life</l>
<l n="5634"> And will return to the devil.</l>
<l n="5635"> With his power, he redeemed</l>
<l n="5636"> He whom the Virgin breastfed</l>
<l n="5637"> Through the very holy Passion.</l>
<l n="5638"> You will have a dignified prize</l>
<l n="5639"> From the great celestial king</l>
<l n="5640"> When you will be to his right</l>
<l n="5641"> In Paradise, where your place</l>
<l n="5642"> Is already reserved, as I learned.</l>
<l n="5643"> You are also well known</l>
<l n="5644"> By God and you will be</l>
<l n="5645"> Supported by the good people in spite of Fauvel.</l>
<l n="5646"> His false veil will fall in a hideous fashion</l>
<l n="5647"> Even if we must wait a little while.</l>
<l n="5648"> Everyone will despise him then.”</l>
<l n="5649"> After this, Fortune leaves.</l>
<l n="5650"> Of he who distributes all good things,</l>
<l n="5651"> The Virtues humbly </l>
<l n="5652"> Ask for protection and quickly</l>
<l n="5653"> Return towards Hope.</l>
<l n="5654"> There they remain at the request</l>
<l n="5655"> Of Fortune the wise.</l>
<l n="5656"> But I tell you with certainty</l>
<l n="5657"> That never had good people had as great a joy</l>
<l n="5658"> As when they learned this,</l>
<l n="5659"> Especially the good man,</l>
<l n="5660"> Their host, who, without counting,</l>
<l n="5661"> Left everything to them.</l>
<l n="5662"> He considered himself as a crowned king</l>
<l n="5663"> When he saw that God had rendered them a service</l>
<l n="5664"> Against the fallacious</l>
<l n="5665"> Fauvel, whom all will abandon</l>
<l n="5666"> And despise, as is in their power.</l>
<l n="5667"> Never had such great horses</l>
<l n="5668"> For jousting been seen</l>
<l n="5669"> In the country, in mountains or valleys,</l>
<l n="5670"> Especially bred horses,</l>
<l n="5671"> As were those of the ladies that day,</l>
<l n="5672"> Which they offered without hesitation</l>
<l n="5673"> To the good people who gathered there</l>
<l n="5674"> And to the jonglers who were there.</l>
<l n="5675"> And the rumor has already flown </l>
<l n="5676"> Everywhere that</l>
<l n="5677"> These women who have jousted</l>
<l n="5678"> Are those who will hold the circle</l>
<l n="5679"> Of the world and its center </l>
<l n="5680"> Without any objection </l>
<l n="5681"> And without which no man who is alive</l>
<l n="5682"> Can arrive on the path of salvation.</l>
<l n="5683"> On foot and on horseback,</l>
<l n="5684"> Through mountains and valleys,</l>
<l n="5685"> They fill the path and the road,</l>
<l n="5686"> Those who leave their houses to see the ladies.</l>
<l n="5687"> There is no lady or lord</l>
<l n="5688"> Who does not show greater joy</l>
<l n="5689"> Than any seen before,</l>
<l n="5690"> So much are they joyful because of the arrival</l>
<l n="5691"> Of the ladies and because of their stay.</l>
<l n="5692"> Each one praises God</l>
<l n="5693"> And exerts efforts to show his joy.</l>
<l n="5694"> Everywhere bells sound,</l>
<l n="5695"> Trumpets, tambourines, drums and bagpipes.</l>
<l n="5696"> Jongleurs pull all sorts of stunts.</l>
<l n="5697"> There is no one who is lazy!</l>
<l n="5698">  Everyone cries out: “May they be welcome!”</l>
<l n="5699"> And show, in their appearance, their great desire</l>
<l n="5700"> To please these ladies.</l>
<l n="5701"> Whoever could give to them gave to them,</l>
<l n="5702"> And abandoned whatever he had:</l>
<l n="5703"> Horses, crowns and brooches,</l>
<l n="5704"> Fabrics, belts and precious rings,</l>
<l n="5705"> Goblets, cups of gold and silver.</l>
<l n="5706"> But they took little, for they were</l>
<l n="5707"> Honorable people and free from greed.</l>
<l n="5708"> They did not want anything from other people.</l>
<l n="5709"> They were escorted to their inns</l>
<l n="5710"> And very honored</l>
<l n="5711"> And when it came time to take leave,</l>
<l n="5712"> Each one of them knew well how</l>
<l n="5713"> To thank the appropriate person</l>
<l n="5714"> And felt obliged</l>
<l n="5715"> To them out of pure and true affection,</l>
<l n="5716"> Without rubbing Fauvel at all.</l>
<l n="5717"> On the sly, Fauvel had already assembled</l>
<l n="5718"> As many people as he could</l>
<l n="5719"> At his home, among his relatives</l>
<l n="5720"> Of which there was a great abundance,</l>
<l n="5721"> And Vainglory and her friends,</l>
<l n="5722"> Were gathered with Fauvel’s people.</l>
<l n="5723"> They forget their shame</l>
<l n="5724"> But were angrier than they appeared.</l>
<l n="5725"> Despite all of this they had their party</l>
<l n="5726"> And have not separated since.</l>
<l n="5727"> Fauvel slept so often</l>
<l n="5728"> With Vainglory that she had</l>
<l n="5729"> From Fauvel—without giving an exact count—</l>
<l n="5730"> Many children, for she gave birth to many.</l>
<l n="5731"> Everywhere there are already new little Fauvels</l>
<l n="5732"> Who are worse than wolf cubs.</l>
<l n="5733"> His lineage grew so much</l>
<l n="5734"> That no greater had ever been seen!</l>
<l n="5735"> He advanced well in this world,</l>
<l n="5736"> And sent his friends everywhere!</l>
<l n="5737"> But above all things I lament</l>
<l n="5738"> The beautiful garden full of grace</l>
<l n="5739"> Where God, through a special decision,</l>
<l n="5740"> Planted the flower of loyalty</l>
<l n="5741"> And sowed excellently</l>
<l n="5742"> The noble grain and seed</l>
<l n="5743"> Of the flower of Christianity</l>
<l n="5744"> And other flowers in great abundance:</l>
<l n="5745"> The flowers of peace and the flowers of justice,</l>
<l n="5746"> The flower of faith and the flower of nobility,</l>
<l n="5747"> The flower of honor and the flower which bloomed</l>
<l n="5748"> With wisdom and knighthood.</l>
<l n="5749"> Such a garden, which is adorned with such flowers,</l>
<l n="5750"> Was born under a good star.</l>
<l n="5751"> This is the garden of sweet France.</l>
<l n="5752"> Alas! What a misfortune</l>
<l n="5753"> That into this very beautiful orchard</l>
<l n="5754"> Fauvel came to take up residence.</l>
<l n="5755"> If only he had not had the eyes or the teeth</l>
<l n="5756"> With which he entered into it,</l>
<l n="5757"> For the animal full of all evil</l>
<l n="5758"> Leads his wife into the garden</l>
<l n="5759"> And all of his allies</l>
<l n="5760"> Who have wickedly entrapped us.</l>
<l n="5761"> And because this makes me angry,</l>
<l n="5762"> I place this motet here, whomever it might upset:</l>
<l n="5763"> There is an even greater marvel</l>
<l n="5764"> That makes me think</l>
<l n="5765"> And reflect very often:</l>
<l n="5766"> This is that Heresy has promised</l>
<l n="5767"> Fauvel to prolong his life</l>
<l n="5768"> And that of his wife and his lineage</l>
<l n="5769"> Through the fountain of youth.</l>
<l n="5770"> This is where she wishes that he and his family</l>
<l n="5771"> Will bathe to rejuvenate themselves!</l>
<l n="5772"> Old men, who are older than Mathusalem was,</l>
<l n="5773"> Do not hesitate to come there; </l>
<l n="5774"> They went there all together,</l>
<l n="5775"> The invalids and the paralyzed.</l>
<l n="5776"> All of the old people come to drink in one gulp</l>
<l n="5777"> And the false people, devoid of all goodness,</l>
<l n="5778"> Adorned with filth and sin,</l>
<l n="5779"> Believe they return to youth.</l>
<l n="5780"> This fountain emits a vapor</l>
<l n="5781"> With which everyone cleans his face</l>
<l n="5782"> And which effaces old age.</l>
<l n="5783"> May God grant that a purified dew</l>
<l n="5784"> Descend from the sky,</l>
<l n="5785"> And he will do it, which will efface</l>
<l n="5786"> Their intention! I do not know when this will be.</l>
<l n="5787"> In this beautiful, pure garden</l>
<l n="5788"> Permanently decorated with golden lily flowers,</l>
<l n="5789"> Fauvel made this fountain come.</l>
<l n="5790"> May God grant him bad luck!</l>
<l n="5791"> I will tell you the truth, if God helps me,</l>
<l n="5792"> About the fountain, out of which</l>
<l n="5793"> A fog emerges every morning</l>
<l n="5794"> Which has completely poisoned the vegetation</l>
<l n="5795"> And the whole garden,</l>
<l n="5796"> For from the fountain a stench</l>
<l n="5797"> Of old sins wafts</l>
<l n="5798"> As a result of which I am in a great sweat,</l>
<l n="5799"> And which comes from the sons and daughters</l>
<l n="5800"> Of Fauvel who do worse than worms</l>
<l n="5801"> And any other bad vermine.</l>
<l n="5802"> There is neither seed nor root,</l>
<l n="5803"> Leaf nor branch nor scion</l>
<l n="5804"> That they do not destroy!</l>
<l n="5805"> There they accomplish their desire fully,</l>
<l n="5806"> As a result of which everyone must mourn.</l>
<l n="5807"> In the most beautiful places, they beat and stomp</l>
<l n="5808"> On the flowers and crush them to the ground,</l>
<l n="5809"> So that it seems, and it is true,</l>
<l n="5810"> That there is no longer a single flower or rose,</l>
<l n="5811"> No faith and no loyalty.</l>
<l n="5812"> Alas! France, how your beauty</l>
<l n="5813"> Falls today into great ruin</l>
<l n="5814"> Through Fauvel’s troop</l>
<l n="5815"> Which places its delights in all evil.</l>
<l n="5816"> They have delivered such a blow to the lily flower,</l>
<l n="5817"> Fauvel and Vainglory together,</l>
<l n="5818"> That she wavers, it seems to me.</l>
<l n="5819"> Fortune, how can you suffer</l>
<l n="5820"> That such a thief be granted</l>
<l n="5821"> Such an abundance of good things and such nobility,</l>
<l n="5822"> And what does it mean that your heart is not wounded</l>
<l n="5823"> That he dared to cross your threshold</l>
<l n="5824"> With his poisonous decision</l>
<l n="5825"> To ask for your hand in marriage,</l>
<l n="5826"> You who are the sovereign lady</l>
<l n="5827"> Of the whole world, after the queen</l>
<l n="5828"> To whom the whole sky bows down.</l>
<l n="5829"> Oh, pure lady of the sky,</l>
<l n="5830"> Honored by the saints</l>
<l n="5831"> In the celestial court,</l>
<l n="5832"> Pray especially</l>
<l n="5833"> To your sweet son, the savior of the world,</l>
<l n="5834"> That he confound Fauvel completely</l>
<l n="5835"> And free us from him, and his comb,</l>
<l n="5836"> And his followers, who are so vile.</l>
<l n="5837"> In doing this, do not be weak.</l>
<l n="5838"> I make this prayer to you through this treble [three-voiced motet?]</l>
<l n="5839"> Lord God, spiritual father,</l>
<l n="5840"> Omnipotent, wise and true,</l>
<l n="5841"> Who abides in the holy Trinity</l>
<l n="5842"> In one selfsame divinity,</l>
<l n="5843"> Who made the earth from nothing,</l>
<l n="5844"> Sea and sky and whatever it encompasses,</l>
<l n="5845"> Who made man in your image</l>
<l n="5846"> And gave him sense and power</l>
<l n="5847"> To obtain perfect joy</l>
<l n="5848"> And the law that you gave him,</l>
<l n="5849"> If he wants to observe it loyally,</l>
<l n="5850"> Lord who generously rewards</l>
<l n="5851"> Each person according to his merits,</l>
<l n="5852"> Whether to his gain or loss,</l>
<l n="5853"> Who so loved the human race</l>
<l n="5854"> That you freed it from slavery</l>
<l n="5855"> To the enemy and the death</l>
<l n="5856"> Of hell, which has put many to death,</l>
<l n="5857"> From your sovereign throne, </l>
<l n="5858"> You sent your son, your own wisdom,</l>
<l n="5859"> Who with you is one essence,</l>
<l n="5860"> And the Holy Spirit,</l>
<l n="5861"> As Scripture explains,</l>
<l n="5862"> Through which our sins are lightened,</l>
<l n="5863"> And made his divinity</l>
<l n="5864"> Dress itself in our humanity,</l>
<l n="5865"> Through the Virgin, ineffably,</l>
<l n="5866"> Without the pure Virgin</l>
<l n="5867"> Sustaining any corruption</l>
<l n="5868"> In the body, soul or thought.</l>
<l n="5869"> From her was he born in Bethlehem.</l>
<l n="5870"> There was God joined to man</l>
<l n="5871"> And then he lived among men</l>
<l n="5872"> For thirty two years, just as Scripture</l>
<l n="5873"> Has taught us, and he preached</l>
<l n="5874"> And gave many good examples.</l>
<l n="5875"> He accomplished so many beautiful miracles</l>
<l n="5876"> That no man had heard of similar ones,</l>
<l n="5877"> And all of this for our instruction.</l>
<l n="5878"> The felonious, hypocritical Jews,</l>
<l n="5879"> The cursed race of God,</l>
<l n="5880"> Mourned this evilly.</l>
<l n="5881"> And they searched for false witnesses</l>
<l n="5882"> And accused him treacherously</l>
<l n="5883"> To the false judge Pilate</l>
<l n="5884"> Who, knowing their trickery,</l>
<l n="5885"> And their envy and their perversity,</l>
<l n="5886"> Judged it good to do their bidding,</l>
<l n="5887"> And, in order to wash his hands of this, made it</l>
<l n="5888"> Understood that he was displeased</l>
<l n="5889"> And that this was not his decision.</l>
<l n="5890"> This was perfect hypocrisy!</l>
<l n="5891"> This can be well perceived</l>
<l n="5892"> Since the facts argue in the same direction as the words,</l>
<l n="5893"> At least this obviously!</l>
<l n="5894"> And for this he received the payment</l>
<l n="5895"> Which must result from such a crime,</l>
<l n="5896"> And may he suffer this with no end!</l>
<l n="5897"> Then the Savior was tied up,</l>
<l n="5898"> Spat upon, beaten, crucified,</l>
<l n="5899"> Hanged on the holy scale,</l>
<l n="5900"> Stuck with a lance in his side,</l>
<l n="5901"> From which blood and water came out.</l>
<l n="5902"> Those who saw this have written it,</l>
<l n="5903"> As wise and sensible people,</l>
<l n="5904"> And their account is true.</l>
<l n="5905"> This was our redemption,</l>
<l n="5906"> This our intention.</l>
<l n="5907"> There, he suffered death because of envy</l>
<l n="5908"> But in dying he gave us life.</l>
<l n="5909"> His death killed our death</l>
<l n="5910"> As a result of which we were prisoners and condemned.</l>
<l n="5911"> And he resurrected us from death</l>
<l n="5912"> When he threw his friends out of hell</l>
<l n="5913"> Where they lay, more uncomfortable than in chains,</l>
<l n="5914"> And then hell was looted</l>
<l n="5915"> And the devils astonished,</l>
<l n="5916"> And they believed they had been betrayed.</l>
<l n="5917"> They did not know how to behave</l>
<l n="5918"> When they saw hell lit up</l>
<l n="5919"> And their dark cavern</l>
<l n="5920"> Which had never been joyous,</l>
<l n="5921"> Light up with such great lights.</l>
<l n="5922"> But they could do nothing, for he</l>
<l n="5923"> Who came to be their host</l>
<l n="5924"> Effaced and took away the shadows</l>
<l n="5925"> And illuminates all obscurity</l>
<l n="5926"> Through the rays of his pure light.</l>
<l n="5927"> He was the host, literally,</l>
<l n="5928"> He who wanted to take away  rather than put things there.</l>
<l n="5929"> With him, hell has a very bad host</l>
<l n="5930"> For he took away all of its people</l>
<l n="5931"> And brought them straight onto the path</l>
<l n="5932"> Towards his paradise, full of joy,</l>
<l n="5933"> Where they will live forever in happiness</l>
<l n="5934"> Without suffering or sadness.</l>
<l n="5935"> Good, sweet father, full of pity,</l>
<l n="5936"> Who so loved virginity</l>
<l n="5937"> That the very holy Virgin,</l>
<l n="5938"> When you were suspended on the high cross,</l>
<l n="5939"> Where you suffered a cruel death,</l>
<l n="5940"> You commanded John, the virgin apostle,</l>
<l n="5941"> To protect her as your spouse.</l>
<l n="5942"> Since this is our belief</l>
<l n="5943"> And because it is true, seek vengeance on our behalf</l>
<l n="5944"> On Fauvel, who leads the whole of the fruit of France</l>
<l n="5945"> To perdition.</l>
<l n="5946"> If you do not deliver a remedy,</l>
<l n="5947"> Because of him, all will return</l>
<l n="5948"> To hell! Oh, God, from this event</l>
<l n="5949"> Deign to protect and defend us.</l>
<l n="5950"> Without delay, make Fauvel and his whole family</l>
<l n="5951"> Descend there,</l>
<l n="5952"> For he drinks and devours the blood</l>
<l n="5953"> From your wound, which you redeemed</l>
<l n="5954"> With your precious blood! Things</l>
<l n="5955"> Are in your power and will be kept silent</l>
<l n="5956"> If he mocks you in this way</l>
<l n="5957"> And if you do not defend your cause.</l>
<l n="5958"> I will maintain without pausing</l>
<l n="5959"> That if he remains unpunished in this way</l>
<l n="5960"> And if you do not give him what he deserves,</l>
<l n="5961"> You people will be astonished</l>
<l n="5962"> And all will go from bad to worse.</l>
<l n="5963"> Sweet Jesus Christ, rush to assault Fauvel,</l>
<l n="5964"> For he ruins and devours everything!</l>
<l n="5965"> Sweet God, do not treat with indifference</l>
<l n="5966"> The Virtues, who show their worth so much</l>
<l n="5967"> In protecting us here below.</l>
<l n="5968"> Bring an end to Fauvel and his people,</l>
<l n="5969"> Very sweet lily of virginity!</l>
<l n="5970"> Protect the Virtues, for they sustain</l>
<l n="5971"> Truth, and hold in your power</l>
<l n="5972"> The lily and the garden of France,</l>
<l n="5973"> And place Fauvel in such a prison</l>
<l n="5974"> That he will not be able to commit treason,</l>
<l n="5975"> So that you, God, king of justice,</l>
<l n="5976"> Are honored, as well as the Holy Church.</l>
<l n="5977"> Ferrant has perished, and so should have perished</l>
<l n="5978"> Fauvel, who does not find anyone to stop him</l>
<l n="5979"> In this world, for all obey</l>
<l n="5980"> Him; he has stolen everything!</l>
<l n="5981"> He has robbed us completely with his seductive words,</l>
<l n="5982"> And deceived us in stealing from us.</l>
<l n="5983"> He will perish, for he cannot</l>
<l n="5984"> Live forever. Here ends my second book.</l>
<l n="5985"> May God receive it willingly.</l>
<l n="5986"> I am thirsty; it is time for me to drink!</l>
