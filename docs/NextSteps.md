NEXT STEPS FOR FAUVEL
Alison Y. Chang & Brendan K. Chou, Aug 2013

** General **
- Get English translation of picture captions and music lyrics
	- Incorporate into current EnglishXML file; use other Content XMLs as example
		- See “XML Guide” Google Doc
:- Develop Annotation app 
- Add in Strubel/other established scholars’ annotations
- Prepare all audio/visual files needed for music StudyTab
For each music object:
- Create MuseScore file (.mscz) by entering/using electronic score recognition for modern notation
- Create image file (.png) for each page of the score
- Create audio files: one overall recording and, for polyphonic music, one additional file for each individual voice. MuseScore saves these as .wav, but then you should convert them to .wma for our project.
- In the OriginalTextXML, add “part” Attribute information for each voice in polyphonic music of Fauvel
- Finish save page functionality
- Make the app run smoother and faster
- Load a new page in the background to make the UI smoother

** Search App **
- In multi-word search, consider returning results that don’t match 100% of the words 
- See “Challenges of Digital Fauvel” Google Doc, “Search Capabilities” section
- Speed up search processes
- Color the scrollbar so that listbox backgrounds don't have to be light gray
